It would be nice to be able to relive those moments but cycling seems like a very serious pursuit these days — just look at all those riders going very fast in their skintight jerseys — that it feels intimidating. But we all need to start somewhere.', '“If a customer says they want to start riding as an exercise, I will advise them to get a basic bicycle that’s a variant of a mountain bicycle (MTB),” says Kenny Tan, owner of Wheelsman Cycles in Seksyen 13, Shah Alam. “An entry level 21-speed bicycle will cost a few hundred ringgit and is sufficient to ride around the park or your housing area.”', '“An MTB is more stable because it has wider wheels and handlebar configuration. You’re also sitting upright so you’re more comfortable. An intermediate level MTB will have suspensions but that’s not necessary at this point.”', 'You will not be very fast on this bicycle because it’s quite heavy, around 15kg, while seven-speed on the rear cassette is tough when going uphill. But it’s decent enough for someone who wants to ride short distances, whether to kickstart a fitness regimen or for a cardio routine that is not too taxing.', 'Precautions for the rider include wearing a helmet as well as fitting a bell, which is especially important if you’re sharing paths with runners and joggers. Wear sports shoes to protect the feet and lightweight sweat-wicking apparel to keep cool.', 'Meanwhile, some explanation on the bicycle lingo. “21-speed” refers to the bicycle’s gear, which you get by multiplying the number of sprockets near the pedal with the sprockets on the rear tyre. But it’s not uncommon to just mention the rear gear, in this case seven-speed. A group of sprockets on the rear tyre is called a cassette.', '', '', 'ROAD RACING', 'If you’re fitter and more adventurous, you might want to ride further. For Shah Alam folks, Tan recommends the Guthrie Corridor Expressway. Cyclists can ride on the motorcycle lane, which is wide enough to allow faster motorcycles to take over — not that it’s a very busy highway anyway.', 'At this point you can upgrade to an intermediate level MTB, which is lighter — around 13kg — and has more gears. But this sort of bicycle is meant for off-road racing; the wider tyres with knobs help keep a grip on dirt, mud or rocks and the wide handlebar creates drag so the rider is slower and more stable on the uneven terrain.', 'For the open road, a road or racing bicycle is more conducive. These bicycles have a thinner frame, narrower tyres and curvy drop handlebars which help riders achieve a more aerodynamic body shape so that they can go faster.', '“If you want to cycle at a hilly area such as Genting Peras or Fraser’s Hill, do not cycle with a seven or eight-speed rear gear. It’s not enough to help you climb comfortably. It’s preferable to use nine, ten or 11-speed, which is the latest.', '“A nine-speed aluminium bicycle costs between RM1,900 and RM2,500, and is a good choice for a seasoned beginner or an intermediate rider. The weight is between nine and 10kg, while higher end bicycles, made of carbon fibre, can weigh as low as 6.5kg”', 'A lighter bicycle will benefit the rider when going uphill, but that’s not the only thing you need to consider. The rider’s weight matters too because when the combined load is heavy, more effort is needed and the tougher it is to climb.', 'So for two riders who are equally fit and riding bicycles with the same weight, the lighter rider will be faster than the heavier one when going uphill.', 'However, it’s the opposite when going downhill as the heavier rider will have more momentum, thanks to their weight and the pull of gravity. The lighter rider will have to pedal downhill just to keep up.', '“A rider should maintain a suitable body weight so that riding is more enjoyable and they can cycle longer distances without getting tired,” says Tan. “You also shouldn’t think that a lighter bicycle is better. It’s about training your muscles so you can go uphill and downhill at a comfortable pace.”', '', '', 'SIZE DOES MATTER', 'Bicycle newbies occasionally ask Tan why they end up exhausted after a ride even though they’ve been cycling consistently for some time. He found that it’s because they did not use the bicycle gears correctly.', '“There is no need to tire yourself, just change the gear,” says Tan. “If you have a seven or eight-speed bicycle but you use the wrong gear, it will be harder to pedal and you would have used a lot of energy. Switch the gears until you get to the one that is easy for you to move forward because when you pedal, you should feel relaxed.”', 'Another common issue comes from customers using bicycles that do not suit their height or body shape. In the local market, entry level MTB only comes in two sizes so the rider will just have to make the best of it. But these are for short trips so it’s not a major concern.', 'But longer rides on an ill-fitting bicycle can lead to serious discomfort on the lower back, shoulders, knees and hamstring.', '“When the bicycle is the wrong size, your sitting posture is wrong so you will hurt your back. If the bicycle is big and you are small, you have to stretch your legs a lot more to pedal and after five or six kilometres, you will start to feel pain,” Tan warns.', 'For MTB, size is measured in inches from the seat tube to the crank, which is the component that’s attached to the pedal. An S-size MTB measures 15 inches and is ideal for those between 165cm and 170cm. M size is for 170cm to 180cm while anyone taller or shorter will need a special order for an L or XS-sized bike respectively.', 'Racing bicycle also come in four sizes although the specifics may differ according to brands. The measurement comes from the top tube and in general, the top tube for an XS bicycle is 50cm and is suitable for those between 155cm to 163cm.', 'S size has a 52cm top tube and is for riders between 164cm and 168cm. M is for those who are 170cm to 178cm while the top tube is 54cm. Anyone taller than that can opt for the L size which has a 56cm top tube.', '“There’s not a big difference in the length of each top tube,” says Tan. “But it makes a very big difference to your riding comfort. Because you are leaning down to hold the handlebar, and with gravity pulling you down, you may feel a bit unstable.', '“There may be some discrepancy to the sizing guideline as the bike fit can also depend on the length of your arms and torso. Other adjustments include changing the length of the stem, which is the component that’s attached to the handlebar.”', '', '', 'TRAIN HARD', 'Meanwhile, a popular alternative is the folding bicycle. The folding capability makes it convenient for transportation and storage and it can be used comfortably by people of various height.', 'Although the frame is smaller than a conventional bicycle, the seat and handlebar can be adjusted easily to suit full-grown adults and older children. “It’s what I would recommend if you are short and can’t find a bicycle in your size,” says Tan.', '“You can also adjust it to suit your riding style. If the seat is higher than the handlebar you are more aerodynamic but if the handlebar is higher you’d be sitting upright and it is more comfortable. And you can share a folding bicycle with other people more easily than an MTB or racing bicycle.”', 'Regardless of bicycle type, the most important thing is to go out and ride, says Tan. There’s no point in getting the latest in bicycle technology if you don’t know how to maximise your potential as a rider in the first place.', '“It will not matter if you get the lightest bicycle if you don’t have the muscles to power it. So train yourself first with the bicycle that you have. Build strength in your legs and core muscles. When you get a better bicycle it will be so much easier,” he says.', '', '', 'aznim.ruhana@nst.com.my', '', '', '', 'NSC to meet on Monday to review strategies to combat Covid-19', 'PM confident he has support of majority', '32 Barisan Nasional MPs pledge support for Muhyiddin', '', '', '', '', '', '']"

They believe that smoke can clear a room or place of bad energy.', 'This practice has been adopted by the hippie and New Age communities too for the same purpose.', 'While you can’t scientifically measure this “bad energy” and how it is impacted by sage smoke, the herb has been proven to contain antibacterial, antiviral, antifungal and antioxidant properties. These properties make it a popular and effective ingredient in skin and hair care products.', 'Organic Way from Italy, or Oway, uses sage in its treatment to a battle greasy and oily scalp.', '“For salon treatments, the sage comes in powdered form and we mix it with Amazonian white clay,” says Eno Yahaya, senior hairstylist at Karva Salon for Ladies by Nora Danish. “We mix it fresh for each customer, and it’s very good for controlling oil production.”', 'Karva has been carrying the Oway brand since it opened in April and this is based on the recommendation of the original Karva salon owners in Singapore. Oway uses plant-based ingredients grown in biodynamic conditions, which is an agricultural practice similar to organic farming but with added esoteric factors.', 'Aside from sage, Oway also uses thyme for dandruff treatment and the flower helichrysum to treat sensitive scalp. “Oway treatments focus on scalp care. It’s like growing a plant, you need to take care of the roots to grow a healthy plant; it’s same with hair,” says Eno.', '', '', 'SAGE ADVICE', 'As the sage and clay paste is worked onto my scalp, the herby scent gives off a relaxing feeling. It gets more relaxing as my stylist proceeds to give me a head and shoulder massage. The paste is then washed off twice with a sebum balancing shampoo from the same line before a cream mask is applied and my head gets placed under a hair steamer for 15 minutes.', 'According to its website, Oway grows a number of plants for its products at its farm Ortofficina near Bologna in Italy. It covers 50,000 square meters, with thyme, sage, lavender and rosemary farmed in the biodynamic method.', '“The deep bond with nature and the complete respect of its rhythms lead us to put an end to the use of synthetic mineral fertilisers and chemical pesticides and to manage the land following the cosmic and lunar cycles, based on an astronomical calendar,” it explains.', 'The company then makes essential oils from these herbs on site. Other ingredients are purchased elsewhere from certified growers, such as citruses from southern Italy. It doesn’t do any animal testing, and the packaging is recyclable.', 'The result from my sebum balancing treatment is clean, fresh scented scalp and hair that is light and bouncy. Actress and salon owner Nora Danish says she had the same pleasant outcome when she tried it for the first time.', '“As a celebrity, I do a lot of things to my hair and it gets damaged that way. I’ve done a lot of treatments but after the first time with Oway I was in love. My hair used to be thinner and I’d wear hair extensions but it’s thicker now because I have a healthier scalp.”', 'Meanwhile, Nora’s priority for the salon is to offer safe and halal products, from the hair colour to the nail polish. While she did not set out specifically for a botanical or organic hair range (she also offers conventional brands), Oway works well with her original plan.', '“We believe that using healthier, more natural ingredients that are rich in active ingredients and without chemicals are good for our customers and staff. There are also rising number of guests that wear hijab who are concerned about hair loss and other conditions, which Oway can help naturally,” she says.', '', '', 'WIND-POWERED BEAUTY', 'Meanwhile, Gracesalon in Bangsar made the conscious decision to carry the Aveda range since the middle of last year.

He’d been working for some time as a successful salon entrepreneur, but suffered a career burnout and decided to go on a spiritual retreat to India in 1970.', 'It was here that Rechelbacher became inspired to create Aveda using ayurvedic principles. He developed his first clove shampoo in a kitchen in Minneapolis with ayurveda doctors Vinod and Kusum Upadhyay.', 'While Rechelbacher passed away in 2014, the duo are still involved with the company. It also maintains its ayurvedic roots in India through a partnership with a local firm called Nisarga to grow produce like turmeric and amla (Indian gooseberry) for some of its products.', '“Aveda sources ingredients with organic certification from all over the world,” says Aveda technical educator Eddy Chan. “But the products are all made at its plant in Minneapolis which is wind-powered, and it doesn’t do any animal testing.”', 'That said, Aveda doesn’t claim to be an organic brand because its products still require some form of preservatives or chemicals to extend its shelf life or ensure efficacy.

AZ,HEAL,2019-06-25 13:32:00,Bane of race cheats,Aznim Ruhana Md Yusup,"['', '×', '', 'Running a marathon is not just a test of endurance but also of honesty, writes Aznim Ruhana Md Yusup', 'WITH multiple running events every weekend attracting a diverse crowd, it’s clear that Malaysians have caught the running bug.', 'But amidst the excitement of runners enjoying their morning with finisher medals in hand, there are also those who spoil the fun by being dishonest.', 'Ahead of the Standard Chartered Kuala Lumpur Marathon (SCKLM) 2019 in September, race director Rainer Biemans says he’s seen his share of cheating cases, and taken action on some of them.', 'Depending on the severity, runners may be let off with a warning or face bans for a year or two. Others are prohibited from ever joining again. All will need to return the finisher medal and T-shirt, as well as the prize money.', '“Race cheats are people who knowingly did not run as what they had agreed to, and without informing the organiser,” he explains. “When you sign up, it means you’ve agreed to our rules and regulations.”', 'Cheaters can be so-called professional runners from other countries chasing after a podium finish and prize money, including international athletes who lied about their identity or had refused doping tests.', 'In this case, the motivation is clear. This year’s event, for example, hands out US$17,500 (about RM72,400) to the male and female winners of the open category. (Malaysian winners get RM20,000.)', 'Biemans has filed police reports, demanding they return the prize money and reported all fraudulent parties to their athletic federation.', 'But cheating is not an issue among top Malaysian runners. They know each other and will guard their reputation. Any discrepancies will be noticed quickly. Cheats usually occur among recreational runners, whose reasons are less apparent.', 'There is certainly no prize money at that level, or any other extras of significance, apart from the finisher medal and T-shirt. Perhaps then, it is to have their names announced and photos taken at the finish line. Or the false sense of entitlement and pride in wearing that “hard-earned” medal and T-shirt, which they can use to brag about on social media.', 'But it’s still confounding why some runners cheat because there’s no need for it. Every step, from registering to paying the fee and being on the route on race day, is voluntary. There isn’t a penalty for not finishing. Even Biemans is baffled by it.', '', '', 'I DID IT, HONEST', 'Race cheats include runners who take shortcuts or join the race somewhere along the route, kilometres after the starting line. A runner who takes the MRT to run a 42.2km road race sounds like a joke but it has happened.', '“Last year, we had a guy wearing a polo shirt carrying a plastic bag crossing the finish line. That’s just not realistic. Then there’s the guy who finished twice,” says Biemans, showing me the photo evidence.', '“The announcer had called his arrival on the finisher mat and then half an hour later, he crossed again wearing a different bib. We’ve banned him from running this year.”', 'Other race cheats are runners who did not reach checkpoints before the cut-off time but continued despite their disqualification.', 'For context, the full marathon starts at 3.45am in Dataran Merdeka, and they need to pass KM21 by 7.45am, KM30 by 9.15am and KM36 by 10.20am. Any later and they will be taken off the route, typically by a sweeper bus.', 'Realistically, these runners can no longer finish within the time limit of seven hours and 15 minutes so they need to leave for Biemans’s team to start clearing the roads and reopen them to traffic.', 'But some runners make their way back to the route. Then they cross the finish line, fraudulently claiming to have run all the way within the time limit.', '“Last year, the final checkpoint was at Bank Negara Malaysia. Runners who didn’t make it got a P mark on their bib for ‘participant’. But some runners keep their bib in plastic. After the finish line, they take out the unmarked bib and claim the medal anyway,” says Biemans.', '', '', 'PROOF AND CONSEQUENCES', 'The SCKLM team went through more than 300 possible race cheat cases last year, out of 35,000 results.', 'It’s a very small percentage but worth guarding against because no one likes cheaters, especially other runners. Often they’re the ones who notice and tip off their suspicions.', 'It also helps that SCKLM has an app that tracks each runner in real time. The information is based on the timing chip in the runner’s bib, and anyone can find this information using the bib number.', '“Last year, a spectator was cheering for a female friend who is a sub-four hour runner. Then he saw a male runner within the pack that did not look fit enough to be finishing a marathon in under four hours. So he checked the runner’s split times on the app.”', 'Like many marathons, SCKLM marks certain intervals on the route as splits, say, every five or 10km. It’s a kind of electronic checkpoint, with mats on the road that detect the timing chip, just like the ones at the start and finish line.', '“It seems that this person ran until KM10 and then, straight to the finish line. For the first 10km he was on target to finish in seven hours but he finished in four.', '“There were pictures of him standing around near the finishing area before crossing the line,” Biemans continues. “So we can deduce that he tried, gave up, went to the finish line, waited for a while and sprinted to the finish along with the top female runners.”', 'Once exposed, the individual was slammed on social media. It turned out that he had done the same thing last year. Other race organisers came forward, saying that he’d been cheating at their events as well. He is now banned from SCKLM permanently.', 'When a runner is suspected of cheating, Biemans and his team will look through evidence such as photos and split times. They will call the runner for clarification and ask for their bib to analyse the timing chip.', 'If cheating is confirmed, they will ask the offender to return their finisher medal and T-shirt. Otherwise, the runner will not be allowed to race the following year.', 'Biemans says they have banned 55 runners from this year’s competition. The next step, he believes, is to have a local database of race cheats.', 'This is after he saw the athletes he’d banned from SCKLM on the podium in other races in Malaysia, which he found suspicious.', '', '', 'LEARN TO EARN', 'Race cheats are a thorn to the organiser’s side, and it happens everywhere.', 'Events such as the Berlin Marathon sells finisher T-shirts, presumably to stop people from cheating to get it. Others give medals together with the race pack but Biemans disagrees.', '“We want people to sign up for the full marathon, train for it and finish it.', 'We want them to wear their finisher T-shirt with pride, because they worked for it,” he says. ”Despite our limited resources, we will try to reduce those who try to take advantage.”', 'That said, it’s not logical to barricade the entire route to stop shortcut runners from getting in.', 'Stricter measures such as having more route marshalls, CCTV cameras or bar code scanning for finisher entitlements will raise operation costs and increase the registration fee, currently at RM90 for Malaysians for the full marathon.', 'In 2018, SCKLM gave out a wristband for full marathon runners to collect at KM19 just before entering the DUKE Highway. If they don’t have it, they can’t claim the finisher medal and T-shirt. The problem is, some runners collected more than one, so they ran out of wristbands.', 'So the band as a verification tool is a bust although they will improve on this system this year. But with photo evidence and split points, it’s not difficult to verify each runner. Smaller events with limited resources will have a harder time tracking cheats.', 'Biemans says he’s fine with runners calling out race cheats but not at exposing them publicly. It’s hard to predict what sort of backlash they will receive, he says.', 'At the same time, it’s important that runners realise they are not entitled to a finisher medal and T-shirt just by signing up because those must be earned.', 'If they fail, they can train harder and try again the following year.', '', '', 'aznim.ruhana@mediaprima.com.my', '', '', '', 'NSC to meet on Monday to review strategies to combat Covid-19', 'PM confident he has support of majority', '32 Barisan Nasional MPs pledge support for Muhyiddin', '', '', '', '', '', '']"

Therefore, if you’re reading this without the aid of that astonishing invention, Google Translate (https://translate.google.com/), count yourself fortunate possessing the first prerequisite of a genuine 21st century global citizen.', 'In my opinion, with that good fortune of knowing English or of at least being financially comfortable, comes a degree of responsibility to extend help to others who are less fortunate than we are!', 'On an intellectual level, such assistance might be extended each time we decide to buy a well selected book for someone who isn’t able to do so because of economic constraints or who’s unwilling to do so because of a severe lack of reading role models. That’s the key reason I often go out of my way to buy books for the young children of some of my financial planning clients.', 'On a financial level, however, since English speakers are more sought after than others in higher paying jobs, both in Malaysia and abroad, a fraction of our healthy discretionary income might be put to good use in well-chosen charities and social concerns.', 'Thankfully, our world with its 7.7 billion people (www.worldometers.info/world-population/) is awash today with many avenues to do good and to help our fellow sojourners on this road called LIFE, which we all traverse from entrance to exit, from A-Z, from birth to death.', 'IMPORTANCE OF GENEROSITY', 'I believe we have all encountered great examples of generosity that we can emulate, should we choose to do so. In my case, for instance, while my father did a less than sterling job managing the millions of ringgit that flowed like gushing water through his hands over the almost half a century he ran his law practice in Melaka, before his passing on April 4, 2008, he did teach his children — by example — the importance of generosity and specifically donating to carefully chosen charities.', 'To give you context for what I’m writing here, do note that an old definition of financial planning from a now defunct version of the Certified Financial Planner Board of Standards’ website stated that:', '“Financial planning is the process of meeting your life goals through the proper management of your finances.”', 'Toward that end, most of us share three big life goals:', '1.

Paying for our children’s tertiary education (for those of us who have been blessed to be stewards of the next generation, meaning we have kids); and', '3. Building a general wealth accumulation fund to permit us to live well and, to some extent, to live large (beyond the constraints of a merely adequate lifestyle).', 'In my father’s case, an integral part of living well was being generous. For decades he ran his sole practitioner Melaka law practice from 14, Church Lane (Lorong Gereja), a short walk from the famous red Dutch 17th century administrative Stadthuys building, and a longer but still manageable walk from my alma mater, Melaka High School.', 'Every time someone would come in off the street requesting a donation for a bona fide charity, my father gave… freely. I remember he told me on numerous occasions that his favourite charity was the St. Nicholas’ Home for the Blind in Penang (https://snh.org.my).', 'Although my father and I disagreed about many things in life, his philanthropic focus must have rubbed off on me more than I realised. Recently when I was approached by the cash-constrained Society of the Blind in Malaysia (https://sbm.org.my), I offered to conduct a three-hour financial planning workshop for free on August 17 this year to help the society raise awareness and funds at a charity event.

Tragically, this has the knock-on effect of reducing support for worthy charities that alleviate human suffering.', 'Might I, therefore, audaciously suggest that if you are among the many of us who are still living comfortably with consistent monthly cash flow surpluses, that you then inject into your budget (or planned cash flow statement) a line item for charity?', 'It doesn’t need to be a huge fraction of your income. Even allocating one or two percentage points of your monthly income and channelling it to a worthy cause you care about can help enormously.', 'When we read the news everyday we’re reminded of the disturbing ugliness of human nature. But that’s NOT all humanity stands for! There is another, better, side to us all.', 'So, from the perspective of proactive financial planning, let’s allow structured, budgeted generosity to flow forth from our economic bounty to lighten at least one other person’s burden this week.', 'If enough of us join forces, then this globe we inhabit will become a tad kinder, happier and brighter.', '© 2019 Rajen Devadason', 'Rajen Devadason, CFP, is a Licensed Financial Planner, professional speaker and author.

But it was just around our area!""', 'His father, recalls Halim fondly, knew of his interest for cars so he used to take his son to the football field near their family home in Kampung Benus, Bentong, so he could teach the boy how to drive.

It was also around this time that I started to really be interested in cars, car styling and drawing cars.""', 'It wasn\'t so much the element of speed that piqued the young Halim\'s interest however; it was, surprisingly, design and styling. But then again, perhaps it\'s not so surprising when I learn that this former Science-stream student does have a passion for drawing growing up. ""When I was very small, I was fascinated by the fact that some cars would just go out of fashion very fast, whilst others would just be so timeless,"" he muses, contemplatively.', '', '', 'Adding, he elaborates: ""At the time, I didn\'t know much about styling or proportion, but I noticed that cars like Mercedes Benz would last a long time in terms of styling.

I was curious why this was so.""', 'During his childhood days, he recalls with delightful clarity that his father drove a Datsun Bluebird. His teacher meanwhile, drove a Mini 1275 GT.

We both laugh before he good-naturedly continues: ""Come to think of it, we had nothing when I started with Proton. Of course, there were some Japanese engineers who came and taught car basics before we went for our first real training in Japan in 1985. They sent us two technical engineers who taught us the basics of car development.""', 'Lobbing a mischievous glance at his wife who\'s seated on the sofa opposite us, he confides: ""It was a challenging period, on the personal front as well, because I\'d just got married. I don\'t think I\'d be able to marry had I not married before I started with Proton!""', 'Chuckling at my confusion, he elaborates: ""We worked very long hours because we knew nothing about car development. It was 8am to 10pm every day. We had to set up everything. There were no SOPs, no procedures, no format… We were basically walking blind. Thankfully, my wife was able to put up with it!""', 'LESSONS FROM THE JAPANESE', '', '', 'Recalling the collaboration with Mitsubishi Motors, Halim admits that it was an interesting experience. ""Being a Japanese car company, I noted that their approach to car design and styling was very different.""', 'Elaborating, he explains: ""In a nutshell, their designs were more \'fashionable\', whereas the European cars tended to be more elegant and timeless. What made them timeless is their proportion — how they shaped the cars and the simple lines. The Japanese cars meanwhile, tended to be more fanciful, very trendy.""', 'Is that a bad thing, I blurt out. Halim smiles before replying: ""But trendy and fashionable tend to go out of fashion. You see, the Japanese philosophy was different. They wanted to sell cars fast. So every five years you\'d change. Their cars were designed to be obsolete"".', '', '', 'The first generation Proton Saga was based on the 1983 Mitsubishi Lancer Fiore. When it was launched in July 1985, it was produced in both 4-door saloon and 5-door hatchback styles. A quick trivia: The first generation Saga is the longest produced Proton model, having been in production for over 22 consecutive years, until it was subsequently succeeded by the second generation Saga in early 2008.', '""Because we already had a base model, the Mitsubishi Lancer, all we had to do was change the front and rear parts of the car, adding the badges and some other details. I was instructed to do the cosmetic changes.""', 'Pulling out a photo album from the mountain stacked on the dining table, he excitedly leafs through the pages before stopping at an image: ""See this photo? This was the first cosmetic change for the Saga. Cosmetic means minor changes for the car — the grill, the wedges, some fabric job, colours and so on.""', 'So that was his mission — to learn about that aspect of styling — when Proton flew him to Japan. ""When I first joined Proton, nobody in Malaysia knew about how to build a car,"" he remembers, adding: ""Of course, when I was with SIRIM, I did manage to go on a factory visit to Automobile Association of Malaysia (AAM) in Shah Alam. At that time, Toyota was assembling the Toyota KE40 (Toyota Corolla). That was the only exposure I had with cars.""', 'KEEPING IT IN STYLE', '', '', 'It all started with the styling department, explains Halim. ""We did the car from A-Z, in terms of the styling. The engineering was done by Mitsubishi so there wasn\'t a need for engineers from our side — yet. We started off with the first generation Saga Cosmetic Change Programme, the first ever styling programme done in-house.""', 'When the Shah Alam factory was completed in 1985, the team moved there. ""Although the factory was ready, it was still lacking a lot of things… no gates, no landscaping. And very little manpower. There was probably 10 of us — six in design, plus a clerk, a stenographer, a typist and one engineer. The rest were engineers from Mitsubishi Motors that supported us during the launching.""', 'In 1989, Halim was sent again to MMC Okazaki — this time for the Proton Wira interior design development work with another designer from Proton. This work was completed in April 1990 and the Wira was launched successfully in 1993, continuing with its production until 2007.', '""We actually worked with a professor from UiTM, learning about how designers perceive styling,"" shares Halim. ""Of course, we\'re not like fashion designers where you get a free hand to unleash your creativity. We had a base to work from and keep to.""', 'Taking a pen and a notebook to clarify further, Halim begins to sketch the frame of a car. ""See, we had the Mitsubishi platform already so all we had to do was build everything around it. In a sense, you\'re limited to that platform. You can\'t make the car smaller or bigger. Designers can only work around the wheel base. You can\'t go crazy except maybe in the detailing.""', '', '', 'Halim was responsible for the car\'s interior — specifically, the colours, finishing, and fabric. ""It was tiring because there were so many details to think about,"" he recalls, adding: ""Essentially, everything that\'s designed for the interior is safety-related. There mustn\'t be any sharp edges; you can\'t have anything very shiny because you might blind the driver; you can\'t have fabric that\'s too fancy or dazzling or it will confuse the driver.""', 'Reeling off breathlessly, he continues: ""You need to have a very matte surface so texture is very important. You can\'t have very bright colours because Malaysia has very strong sunlight and it will reflect into your eyes. So the interior must be dark, calming and at the same time, look good and not cheap.""', 'Of course, it\'s all cost-based so to have everything come together well, the car must be safe, look beautiful, and be cost-effective, adds Halim. ""To meet all the requirements wasn\'t easy. You have to please the customer, the marketing and costing people, engineers, and many parties.""', 'It was all very technical, he continues. ""You have to know the manufacturing process, the materials, rules and regulations, costing etc. Most of the time I was out with the vendors, flying all over Taiwan, Korea, Czech Republic, visiting factories to see them make the moulds and the finishing. Most of the time, the factories were cold and dark because I\'d go in winter. It was tough.""', 'The development process was very critical and detailed, explains Halim. His touch is everywhere — from the switches to the panel; the steering wheel to the knobs; the colour of trims, the metre combi, the lighting on the radio, fabric on the roof, floor carpets, and the leather… literally any part of the car which has texture.', 'Smiling wistfully, Halim says: ""People only see the finished product but they don\'t know about all these other things that need to come together. It\'s all accounted for and nothing is by chance.', 'A NEW SHIFT', '', '', 'Suffice it to say, as the years went by, the team became more experienced and there were more collaborations. Remembers Halim: ""The direction by the government was for us to work with other parties. That started the shift. The early days involved just mass production and minor changes. At that time, Tun M wasn\'t too happy because the technology transfer was slow. He wanted things to move faster and for there to be bigger changes.""', 'And that\'s why, adds Halim, Lotus was brought in. And talks ensued with other design houses and parties too. ""Americans, Italians and so on,"" shares the car enthusiast. ""Tun M just wanted us to build our own car. Lotus helped us to build the Waja, which was in 2000. That\'s the real start of a Malaysian-produced car, starting from ground up.""', 'The team took in all the comments they received — from those touching on quality to parts issues and other problems that arose. ""We needed to learn from somewhere because Mitsubishi didn\'t teach us everything,"" exclaims Halim, adding: ""You had to fill in the blanks. Like for example, the styling. The Japanese taught us only the \'skeleton\' and you pandai pandai lah (learn by yourself)!""', ""Of course, there were a lot of challenges, he concedes, although they weren't so much on the design side of operations. By that time, says Halim, pride lacing his voice, the designers were, in terms of their work, quite matured."", '""We weren\'t too far off from others around the world,"" he recalls, adding: ""We went to motor shows etc. But on the engineering side, it was a challenge because nobody could build a good car in less than 10 days. The challenge abound for the engineers more than the stylists.""', ""Mischievously, I ask Halim, who has also participated in the development of other Proton models such as the Satria, Putra, Tiara, Perdana, Waja, as well as various 'Special Edition' models, that with so much headaches to contend with, what was it that he enjoyed most?"", 'He pauses to contemplate the question. Finally, Halim, who retired in October last year after 35 years of service, replies: ""It\'s just my love for the job. I really wanted Malaysia to have her own car. I shared Tun\'s vision. Proton was established just to spearhead the heavy industries. It\'s not the product per se, but you\'re building the engineering environment for the whole of Malaysia.""', '', '', 'Voice low, he continues: ""Proton was just a catalyst. So when it (Proton) started building cars, you had the birth of so many parties to support the industry. People from automotive engineers, to manufacturing, vendors etc. So you build up the environment for Malaysia.""', 'A faraway look in his kindly eyes, Halim adds solemnly: ""I remember back then when Tun said we\'d build our own car. I was also like, ""Impossible. Malaysia can\'t build her own car; we buy from others. We don\'t have the technology, the people, the expertise, and the support. I had so many excuses in my head.""', 'But it wasn\'t long before a sense of patriotism enveloped him. And Halim remembers vowing to silence the doubts. Not only his own but those of others too. ""I thought, why CAN\'T we build our own car and make it just as nice as those on the road. That was what drove me. I wanted to contribute something for the nation — even if it were only something small.""', 'Wistfully, he continues: ""At least I can say I was there, I\'ve done my part for nation-building. Not too many people knew about what I did because everything was confidential. Not even my wife knew what I was doing. All she knew was that I\'d come back late and then fly off again the following week.""', 'His wife nods, her smile gentle. Halim, who used to drive the Saga Magma 1.5, continues: ""I couldn\'t tell her what project I was working on — until the launch of the car. I couldn\'t tell my friends or my relatives. Everything was top secret. That\'s the one thing about being in the R&D department!""', 'And as for the Saga today, going forward?', '', '', 'Again, Halim pauses to reflect before conceding that it\'d be a challenge to maintain the legacy. ""You can probably still keep the name but to produce a Saga which meets the people\'s perception, changing wants and needs… different generation… Well, that\'s going to be tough.""', 'Sheepishly, he says: ""My daughter has a Honda. Different generations have different needs. They want gadgets inside the car. Proton is a small manufacturer. Those technology and stuff you see, all those latest things, they\'re expensive things. You need the economy of scale to have them. If you don\'t have a partner, your cars will be very expensive to sell.""', 'But now that Geely — Zhejiang Geely Holding Group purchased 49.9 per cent of Proton Cars — is on board, Halim\'s slightly more optimistic. ""Hopefully we can come up with a future Saga which meets all these requirements — not only for the Malaysian market but also the global market!', 'intanm@nst.com.my', '', '', '', 'NSC to meet on Monday to review strategies to combat Covid-19', 'PM confident he has support of majority', '32 Barisan Nasional MPs pledge support for Muhyiddin', '', '', '', '', '', '']"

Of course, there were some Japanese engineers who came and taught car basics before we went for our first real training in Japan in 1985. They sent us two technical engineers who taught us the basics of car development.""', 'Lobbing a mischievous glance at his wife who\'s seated on the sofa opposite us, he confides: ""It was a challenging period, on the personal front as well, because I\'d just got married. I don\'t think I\'d be able to marry had I not married before I started with Proton!""', 'Chuckling at my confusion, he elaborates: ""We worked very long hours because we knew nothing about car development. It was 8am to 10pm every day. We had to set up everything. There were no SOPs, no procedures, no format… We were basically walking blind. Thankfully, my wife was able to put up with it!""', 'LESSONS FROM THE JAPANESE', '', '', 'Recalling the collaboration with Mitsubishi Motors, Halim admits that it was an interesting experience. ""Being a Japanese car company, I noted that their approach to car design and styling was very different.""', 'Elaborating, he explains: ""In a nutshell, their designs were more \'fashionable\', whereas the European cars tended to be more elegant and timeless. What made them timeless is their proportion — how they shaped the cars and the simple lines. The Japanese cars meanwhile, tended to be more fanciful, very trendy.""', 'Is that a bad thing, I blurt out. Halim smiles before replying: ""But trendy and fashionable tend to go out of fashion. You see, the Japanese philosophy was different. They wanted to sell cars fast. So every five years you\'d change. Their cars were designed to be obsolete"".', '', '', 'The first generation Proton Saga was based on the 1983 Mitsubishi Lancer Fiore. When it was launched in July 1985, it was produced in both 4-door saloon and 5-door hatchback styles. A quick trivia: The first generation Saga is the longest produced Proton model, having been in production for over 22 consecutive years, until it was subsequently succeeded by the second generation Saga in early 2008.', '""Because we already had a base model, the Mitsubishi Lancer, all we had to do was change the front and rear parts of the car, adding the badges and some other details. I was instructed to do the cosmetic changes.""', 'Pulling out a photo album from the mountain stacked on the dining table, he excitedly leafs through the pages before stopping at an image: ""See this photo? This was the first cosmetic change for the Saga. Cosmetic means minor changes for the car — the grill, the wedges, some fabric job, colours and so on.""', 'So that was his mission — to learn about that aspect of styling — when Proton flew him to Japan. ""When I first joined Proton, nobody in Malaysia knew about how to build a car,"" he remembers, adding: ""Of course, when I was with SIRIM, I did manage to go on a factory visit to Automobile Association of Malaysia (AAM) in Shah Alam. At that time, Toyota was assembling the Toyota KE40 (Toyota Corolla). That was the only exposure I had with cars.""', 'KEEPING IT IN STYLE', '', '', 'It all started with the styling department, explains Halim. ""We did the car from A-Z, in terms of the styling. The engineering was done by Mitsubishi so there wasn\'t a need for engineers from our side — yet. We started off with the first generation Saga Cosmetic Change Programme, the first ever styling programme done in-house.""', 'When the Shah Alam factory was completed in 1985, the team moved there. ""Although the factory was ready, it was still lacking a lot of things… no gates, no landscaping. And very little manpower. There was probably 10 of us — six in design, plus a clerk, a stenographer, a typist and one engineer. The rest were engineers from Mitsubishi Motors that supported us during the launching.""', 'In 1989, Halim was sent again to MMC Okazaki — this time for the Proton Wira interior design development work with another designer from Proton. This work was completed in April 1990 and the Wira was launched successfully in 1993, continuing with its production until 2007.', '""We actually worked with a professor from UiTM, learning about how designers perceive styling,"" shares Halim. ""Of course, we\'re not like fashion designers where you get a free hand to unleash your creativity. We had a base to work from and keep to.""', 'Taking a pen and a notebook to clarify further, Halim begins to sketch the frame of a car. ""See, we had the Mitsubishi platform already so all we had to do was build everything around it. In a sense, you\'re limited to that platform. You can\'t make the car smaller or bigger. Designers can only work around the wheel base. You can\'t go crazy except maybe in the detailing.""', '', '', 'Halim was responsible for the car\'s interior — specifically, the colours, finishing, and fabric. ""It was tiring because there were so many details to think about,"" he recalls, adding: ""Essentially, everything that\'s designed for the interior is safety-related. There mustn\'t be any sharp edges; you can\'t have anything very shiny because you might blind the driver; you can\'t have fabric that\'s too fancy or dazzling or it will confuse the driver.""', 'Reeling off breathlessly, he continues: ""You need to have a very matte surface so texture is very important. You can\'t have very bright colours because Malaysia has very strong sunlight and it will reflect into your eyes. So the interior must be dark, calming and at the same time, look good and not cheap.""', 'Of course, it\'s all cost-based so to have everything come together well, the car must be safe, look beautiful, and be cost-effective, adds Halim. ""To meet all the requirements wasn\'t easy. You have to please the customer, the marketing and costing people, engineers, and many parties.""', 'It was all very technical, he continues. ""You have to know the manufacturing process, the materials, rules and regulations, costing etc. Most of the time I was out with the vendors, flying all over Taiwan, Korea, Czech Republic, visiting factories to see them make the moulds and the finishing. Most of the time, the factories were cold and dark because I\'d go in winter. It was tough.""', 'The development process was very critical and detailed, explains Halim. His touch is everywhere — from the switches to the panel; the steering wheel to the knobs; the colour of trims, the metre combi, the lighting on the radio, fabric on the roof, floor carpets, and the leather… literally any part of the car which has texture.', 'Smiling wistfully, Halim says: ""People only see the finished product but they don\'t know about all these other things that need to come together. It\'s all accounted for and nothing is by chance.', 'A NEW SHIFT', '', '', 'Suffice it to say, as the years went by, the team became more experienced and there were more collaborations. Remembers Halim: ""The direction by the government was for us to work with other parties. That started the shift. The early days involved just mass production and minor changes. At that time, Tun M wasn\'t too happy because the technology transfer was slow. He wanted things to move faster and for there to be bigger changes.""', 'And that\'s why, adds Halim, Lotus was brought in. And talks ensued with other design houses and parties too. ""Americans, Italians and so on,"" shares the car enthusiast. ""Tun M just wanted us to build our own car. Lotus helped us to build the Waja, which was in 2000. That\'s the real start of a Malaysian-produced car, starting from ground up.""', 'The team took in all the comments they received — from those touching on quality to parts issues and other problems that arose. ""We needed to learn from somewhere because Mitsubishi didn\'t teach us everything,"" exclaims Halim, adding: ""You had to fill in the blanks. Like for example, the styling. The Japanese taught us only the \'skeleton\' and you pandai pandai lah (learn by yourself)!""', ""Of course, there were a lot of challenges, he concedes, although they weren't so much on the design side of operations. By that time, says Halim, pride lacing his voice, the designers were, in terms of their work, quite matured."", '""We weren\'t too far off from others around the world,"" he recalls, adding: ""We went to motor shows etc. But on the engineering side, it was a challenge because nobody could build a good car in less than 10 days. The challenge abound for the engineers more than the stylists.""', ""Mischievously, I ask Halim, who has also participated in the development of other Proton models such as the Satria, Putra, Tiara, Perdana, Waja, as well as various 'Special Edition' models, that with so much headaches to contend with, what was it that he enjoyed most?"", 'He pauses to contemplate the question. Finally, Halim, who retired in October last year after 35 years of service, replies: ""It\'s just my love for the job. I really wanted Malaysia to have her own car. I shared Tun\'s vision. Proton was established just to spearhead the heavy industries. It\'s not the product per se, but you\'re building the engineering environment for the whole of Malaysia.""', '', '', 'Voice low, he continues: ""Proton was just a catalyst. So when it (Proton) started building cars, you had the birth of so many parties to support the industry. People from automotive engineers, to manufacturing, vendors etc. So you build up the environment for Malaysia.""', 'A faraway look in his kindly eyes, Halim adds solemnly: ""I remember back then when Tun said we\'d build our own car. I was also like, ""Impossible. Malaysia can\'t build her own car; we buy from others. We don\'t have the technology, the people, the expertise, and the support. I had so many excuses in my head.""', 'But it wasn\'t long before a sense of patriotism enveloped him. And Halim remembers vowing to silence the doubts. Not only his own but those of others too. ""I thought, why CAN\'T we build our own car and make it just as nice as those on the road. That was what drove me. I wanted to contribute something for the nation — even if it were only something small.""', 'Wistfully, he continues: ""At least I can say I was there, I\'ve done my part for nation-building. Not too many people knew about what I did because everything was confidential. Not even my wife knew what I was doing. All she knew was that I\'d come back late and then fly off again the following week.""', 'His wife nods, her smile gentle. Halim, who used to drive the Saga Magma 1.5, continues: ""I couldn\'t tell her what project I was working on — until the launch of the car. I couldn\'t tell my friends or my relatives. Everything was top secret. That\'s the one thing about being in the R&D department!""', 'And as for the Saga today, going forward?', '', '', 'Again, Halim pauses to reflect before conceding that it\'d be a challenge to maintain the legacy. ""You can probably still keep the name but to produce a Saga which meets the people\'s perception, changing wants and needs… different generation… Well, that\'s going to be tough.""', 'Sheepishly, he says: ""My daughter has a Honda. Different generations have different needs. They want gadgets inside the car. Proton is a small manufacturer. Those technology and stuff you see, all those latest things, they\'re expensive things. You need the economy of scale to have them. If you don\'t have a partner, your cars will be very expensive to sell.""', 'But now that Geely — Zhejiang Geely Holding Group purchased 49.9 per cent of Proton Cars — is on board, Halim\'s slightly more optimistic. ""Hopefully we can come up with a future Saga which meets all these requirements — not only for the Malaysian market but also the global market!', 'intanm@nst.com.my', '', '', '', 'NSC to meet on Monday to review strategies to combat Covid-19', 'PM confident he has support of majority', '32 Barisan Nasional MPs pledge support for Muhyiddin', '', '', '', '', '', '']"

This is especially during the Covid-19 pandemic, the elderly is the most vulnerable group. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, there were 40.3 million U.S. residents 65 years and older in the 2010 Census and more than 54 million on July 1, 2019.', 'China, meanwhile, is entering a phase of rapid ageing, and there will be about 400 million elderly population in the country by 2033, according to South China Morning Post. Supporting ageing population proves to be a formidable challenge, especially when the number and ratio of elderly are constantly on the rise.', 'Countries like Japan have already been ageing fast; by 2030, one in every three people in Japan will be 65 or older, and one in five people 75-plus years old. Ageing population also proves to be a unignorable issue in Europe, as the population of those aged 65 years or more in the EU-27 will reach 129.8 million by 2050.', ""Southeast Asian countries too, are heading towards ageing society. According to the Asean Post, the population of Singapore over the age of 65 is expected to reach 26.6 per cent in 2035, while older adults in Thailand is expected to reach 22.8 per cent and the country's old-age dependency ratio is estimated to be than 50 per cent by 2050."", ""For Malaysia, the country's Statistics Department reveals that Malaysia would become an ageing society by 2030 when 15 per cent of its population turn to 60 and above."", 'What accountable elderly welfare is much noticeable among policy argumentation. The level of social security and welfare is closely related to the modernization process of national governance, and a major expenditure for social welfare is supporting the ageing population.', ""On the one hand, as the ageing population increases, there are more pressures for the government's expenditure, while on the other hand, this also reflects that the proportion of the working population has declined, the total output capacity of the society has been weakened, government taxation will be reduced, which in turn signifies that the financial power of public expenditure is weakened."", 'According to 2017/2019 statistics, the two largest public social expenditures of Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries are pensions and public health expenditures. The level of public expenditure in each member country is quite different, and this is related to the age structure of the population, the number of elderly people enjoying pension and medical security, and the social security system.', 'In the Netherlands and the United States, social expenditures on personal health and pensions account for more than 12.5% of GDP, the highest proportion among OECD member countries. In terms of pension expenditure, Italy and Greece have the highest proportion of GDP, accounting for more than 15 per cent of GDP. Meanwhile, Iceland, Chile and South Korea have the lowest, which is less than 3 per cent of GDP.', 'To ease the burden on welfare benefits and labor shortages, the mandatory retirement age is increased gradually in some countries. The Abe administration called for a reform of the Japanese pension system to correspond with ""100-year life"". Japan will implement its plan since the year of 2022 to extend the retirement age for their civil servants to 65 in 2030, from the current 60, while large corporate employers like Nojima announced their working age up to 80.', 'Britain has set the timetables to legislate its increase in State Pension Age from 65 to 67.

With Joe Biden emerged victoriously as the 46th US President, the US society will become more integrated than in the past, with some of the major domestic issues, and the future of American society is likely to opt for transformation towards welfare-oriented, which would mean that older population of the US will be likely to receive better health and financial support.', 'Even during his presidential election campaign, Biden had promised a list of supports for the elderly, which includes paid leave and tax credits for families caring for older persons, as well as providing more funding for community-based long-term services and supports, in addition to reforming the Social Security. Although it remains to be seen how effective and efficient all these can be fulfilled, by rolling out pandemic recovery stimulus package, at least some of these aspects will see certain improvements.', 'With high amount of spending for the increasing number of advanced age population, it is particularly daunting for countries during the pandemic period, as well as in the post-Covid world. During the pandemic, elderly people were the most vulnerable group. The age-friendly cities would be well protected with advanced care services, i.e., remote health monitoring, online diagnosis, daily care robots, and mental comfort.', 'Digital solutions that help tackle with issues for population of older ages are to rely on technology collaboration, develop aging products integrated with VR, AI, cloud, IoT, 5G/6G, robotics, biometrics, and anti-digital crime. The equality with access to the Internet and conceivable gadgets could prepare for older people in uncertainties.', ""Foreseeably, scientific and technological welfare will increasingly play more vital roles to reassure the elderly's needs in a city district or a rural village. \u200d\u200dSmart solutions can offer data platforms open to the community and engage business executives who are able to make the public and private partnerships in financing and improving welfare distribution. New forms of business will provide the aging population with more desirable health care, medicare, leisure and entertainment."", 'With the adaptation of technology, elderly services can reduce costs and promote efficiency, alleviate the current situation of poor information circulation and shortage of human resources. There is thus an urgency for policymakers to rethink creating an inclusive service system for elderly people at home, in their community, and in hospice care.', 'All in all, the well-being for the graying population is a pressing issue for governments, medical professions, service industry, property developers, and family members.

They are very common in Malaysia, with an estimated 1 in 10 Malaysians suffering from them.', 'They are also more common in men, the overweight and in people over the age of 50, although they can occur in anyone.', 'The main causes of kidney stone formation are dehydration and excess minerals in the urine. Certain metabolic conditions can also cause stones, but this is less common. Unfortunately, the incidence of kidney stones is increasing as our population ages and rates of obesity rise, as well as a richer diet.', 'People who have formed one kidney stone are also at high risk of forming another, with over 50% having a recurrence over the course of their lifetime.', 'The majority of kidney stones (about 80 per cent) are made of a substance called calcium oxalate. Others are formed from struvite (magnesium aluminium phosphate) or uric acid.', 'Each of these has their specific causes and risk factors. For example struvite stones tend to occur in people with chronic urinary infections and uric acid stones form in people with high levels of this substance in their blood, who may also have gout.', 'Risk factors for the more common calcium oxalate stones are a high salt intake, dehydration and excess calcium in the urine.', 'Stones that form and remain in the kidney frequently cause no symptoms. Occasionally they cause urinary infections. They typical symptom associated with kidney stones - severe pain in the back and', 'side – occurs when stones pass into the ureter, which is the thin tube that leads from the kidney to the bladder. This may also be associated with vomiting, bloody urine and fever.', 'However, not everyone experiences typical symptoms. Some may just have a dull ache in the back or repeated urine infections. Others may have no symptoms at all, and the stones are picked up on scans done for other reasons. If left untreated kidney stones can cause loss of function of the kidney, sepsis, or recurrent pain.', '', '', 'The diagnosis and treatment of kidney stones is carried out by specialists known as urologists. A variety of tests can be used to diagnose kidney stones. Standard x-rays and ultrasound scans are useful for both diagnosis and follow-up, but they do carry some limitations and CT scans are now considered the ""gold standard"" test to diagnose stones. Urine analysis to look for blood, infections, or crystals is usually carried out as well as blood tests to check kidney function and for infection.', 'The treatment of kidney stones depends on their size and position, as well as other medical issues faced by the patient. Very small stones in the kidney may not always need treatment but should be monitored. Small stones in the ureter (less than 3mm) have a good chance of passing spontaneously, and sometimes medication is prescribed to help this process.', 'If there is a larger stone in the ureter, or if it is causing ongoing pain, obstruction or infection then a variety of treatments may be required.', 'How can stones be prevented in the first place? The single most important method is to avoid dehydration. A good guide to your hydration level is to monitor the colour of your urine – it should be pale yellow or clear, and not dark. How much water to drink to achieve this will depend on your level of physical activity, your exposure to heat and sunlight and also what you eat.', 'Most people need to drink at least 2 to 3 litres of fluid daily to maintain a healthy urine output, and most of this should be water rather than sweetened or carbonated drinks.', 'Maintaining a healthy weight is also essential. Excess sodium (salt) in your diet also raises the risk of forming kidney stones, as it increases the level of calcium in your urine. Processed and canned foods tend to have high levels of sodium, as well as instant noodles, soya and fish sauce and fast food. High sodium can also cause high blood pressure, heart disease and stroke.', 'There is no health benefit in using ""exotic"" salts as their sodium content is the same as regular salt. An excess of protein or sugar in the diet has also been shown to increase the risk of kidney stones.', '', '', 'A common misconception is that because many kidney stones are made from calcium, that you should avoid foods containing calcium to prevent them. In fact, large-scale studies have shown that this in fact makes you more likely to form kidney stones.', 'Your diet should include around 1000mg of calcium daily – foods that can help you reach this target are milk, cheese, yoghurt, fish and leafy vegetables. However, calcium supplements can increase the risk of kidney stones and should be avoided if you have suffered from one in the past.', 'Other supplements, particularly protein and vitamin C, can also increase your risk of kidney stones.', 'Simple lifestyle changes can be highly effective in preventing kidney stones, and with a disease that can cause such significant pain and misery, prevention is certainly better than cure.', '*The writer is a consultant urologist at Pantai Hospital Penang.', '', '', '', 'Umno, Bersatu MPs arrive at Istana Negara', 'All eyes on Istana Negara as MPs arrive to meet King', 'Hundreds of houses in Penang hit by flash floods', '', '', '', '', '', '']"

Only 23 per cent preferred online learning because they miss the social aspects of university/campus life.', ""The global scenario is not dissimilar. Malaysia's overall satisfaction is at 75 per cent which is eight percent above the global average of 68 per cent. Students' satisfaction level in Thailand is 85 per cent, Singapore (78 per cent), New Zealand (72 per cent) and Australia, 69 per cent."", 'The take aways from the findings are: while students are understanding of the current exigencies, they are concerned about the poor quality of online learning and see the need for investment in infrastructure, online pedagogy, and quality of online delivery.', 'Institutional leaders must look across the market for quality online provisions and value that higher education to students is not just in the curricula or learning but rather the social and networking opportunities, especially for international students who select the country of study with the world of work in mind.', 'Prof Roslan, Deputy Vice-Chancellor, USM provided some insights to staff organisation and support during the pandemic.

Fatality numbers are 1,360 in Malaysia and 9,500 in Japan, and total deaths per million people are 42 and 75, respectively.', 'These show that Malaysia has done and is still doing better in containing the spike than Japan. Is this prima facie evidence beyond a reasonable doubt? Probably not because of differences in the population size, socioeconomic wellbeing and other factors.', 'Malaysia executed the Movement Control Order (MCO) from March 18 to May 4, 2020, that included restrictions on international inbound and outbound travel. Essential activities were permitted and most businesses later reopened. Mass gatherings were also prohibited.', 'These, however, did not flatten the curve.

On Jan 12, the Yang di-Pertuan Agong declared a national state of emergency until at least Aug 1 to contain the pandemic.', 'The Malaysian government then launched two emergency stimulus packages — Prihatin (RM250 billion) and Penjana (RM35 billion).

medical system,COLUMNISTS,2021-04-24 00:00:00,Importance of vaccinating children,Professor Dr Zabidi Azhar Mohd Hussin,"['', '×', '', 'Immunisation is a simple and effective way of protecting children from serious diseases that are potentially harmful or even deadly. By immunising a child, you not only protect the individual, but also the broader community by minimising the spread of disease.', 'Children are invariably exposed to pathogens through their daily interaction with family members, playmates and schoolmates. Immunisation therefore plays an important role in strengthening their immunity and protection against serious illnesses.', ""Newborns inherit their mother's immunity in the first few months, but this soon wanes. As babies have an underdeveloped immune system, they may be stricken with various infections four to eight times a year. While young children are generally able to fight off most infections, there may be some pathogens or virulent diseases that are beyond their immune system's capability."", 'Essentially, vaccines work by triggering the immune system to fight against a particular disease. They contain the same germ that causes a particular disease. But, the germs in the vaccine have been killed or weakened so that they do not make your child sick.', 'When your child gets immunised, his/her body is tricked into thinking that it has been infected with the disease. It starts to manufacture antibodies that kill the germs. These antibodies stay in the body for a long time.', 'So, if the child comes in contact with the disease, his/her immune system is able to respond more effectively, preventing the disease from developing or greatly reducing its severity.', 'The National Immunisation Programme (NIP), introduced by the Health Ministry since the 1950s to curb the spread of infectious diseases, currently administers free vaccinations to children that protect against 13 potentially harmful diseases.', 'They are Bacillus Calmette-Guerin, a vaccine that gives protection against tuberculosis; 6-in-1 vaccine which contains: diphtheria, tetanus, polio, pertussis, Hepatitis B and Haemophilus Influenza type B; MMR, the combination of Measles, Mumps and Rubella, and HPV (Human Papillomavirus) that protects against cervical cancer. For Sarawak only, there is an additional vaccine that fights against Japanese Encephalitis.', 'Children receive these vaccines within the first 18 months of their lives, except for the HPV vaccine which is given to teenage girls at 13 years of age. Since the NIP was introduced, cases of serious infectious diseases have decreased significantly. Malaysia was declared free from polio in 2000.', 'Regretfully, several worldwide incidents have tainted the good work and noble cause behind the creation of vaccines.', 'A well-known controversy surrounding an article by Andrew Wakefield published in the renowned medical journal, The Lancet in 1998, which claimed that the MMR vaccine causes autism in children. Although the worldwide medical community denounced the article as spreading unnecessary fear in the community through unverified facts, and it was subsequently retracted by The Lancet in 2010, the fallout and damage it created was substantial.', 'Not only did the article and controversy spawn the rise of the global anti-vaxxers movement in the late 1990s, but the resulting number of children who subsequently became ill with measles and the sudden outbreaks of disease in communities in the United Kingdom and America also increased significantly, further burdening their public health systems.', 'Some parents have also raised concerns of the use of thimerosal, a mercury containing compound as a preservative for flu vaccines. Rest assured, as reported by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, except for some flu vaccines in multi-dose vials, no other childhood vaccines contain thimerosal as a preservative. Reputable scientific studies have not found any evidence or association between thimerosal in vaccines and autism.', ""Vaccines for children are safe with few side effects as they are developed after many years of research and have undergone numerous clinical trials. Parents of young children should check with their nearest government clinic on their child's immunisation schedule if they have not already done so."", 'Parents now may have reservations in bringing their children to a clinic or hospital for fear of exposing them to Covid-19, but vaccinations need to be timely to be effective. Stick to the vaccination schedule to ensure optimal protection for your child. Observe standard operating procedures to keep yourself and your child safe.', 'Hopefully, Malaysian parents will heed the call to immunise their children against potentially harmful diseases. Immunisation is an important component of primary healthcare and a human right. The best gift you could give your child is a shot at a healthy start in life.', '', 'The writer is IMU Pro Vice Chancellor, Academic with a special interest in Paediatric Neurology and Medical Education', '', '', '', 'Cabinet, govt machinery continues to function, says Muhyiddin', '553,871 vaccine doses administered yesterday', 'Ceiling price for private sales of vaccines to be set', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '']"

I was concerned that we\'d lose our identity if nothing was done. My time in England showed me just how much the British value their heritage. People come and go but the heritage and identity remain.""', 'So what did he do? ""I started writing papers,"" replies Hajeedar. He wrote the article, A Case for Conservation, KL — a two-part paper, arguing why we needed to conserve our heritage. ""Because we want to know the journey of how far we\'ve gone. We didn\'t just get independence. Independence from whom and for what?""', 'Grimly, he continues: ""And what about these buildings? These are what we inherited as our culture. They shall be a reminder of what we\'ve achieved. Our history of architecture may be relatively young but whatever we inherit shall then become our heritage and due responsibility.""', 'NEW AWARENESS', '', '', 'He points to an Antiquities Act back then but it didn\'t cover buildings. Elaborates Hajeedar: ""People worked around the law to say, ok, it\'s historic, but it\'s MY building. Then they go and monetise it. We were fighting a losing battle.""', ""And because of that awareness and concern, the then-young architect thought that by writing, he'd be contributing to the greater cause. The local papers reproduced the articles he wrote in Majalah Arkitek."", 'But for three years, remembers Hajeedar, nothing happened, except for the occasional messages of support. Then he received a phone call from an assistant of the president of the Industrial Court.', '""It was Tan Sri Harun Hashim, the then-president of the Industrial Court,"" shares Hajeedar, before elaborating: ""He had a bad set of courts within some timber buildings in Jalan Duta. He wanted the new courts and had identified an old building behind the General Post Office (GPO). He asked whether I\'d want to put my money where my mouth is. I said, ok, what do you want me to do? He challenged me to convert it.""', 'And that Hajeedar did. It took him 10 months to successfully restore and readapt the building (Chow Kit Department Store) into the Industrial Court for Harun. ""That was around 1983. He ended up with six courts and was very happy.""', 'Pictures of his before-and-after-work were spotted by the then-Prime Minister, Dr Mahathir Mohamad, during the latter\'s visit to Hajeedar\'s office. He couldn\'t believe that it was in KL. Wryly, Hajeedar shares: ""You see, he\'d been informed that it\'d be too expensive to conserve old buildings. I told him it wasn\'t. And after that, other buildings slated for demolition had the opportunity to be sustained.""', 'Soon after, Mahathir instructed UDA to restore JKR 92, a century-old building used as the KTM headquarters, Selangor JKR and the initial Bank Negara to be the centre for Infokraf.', 'This ""new awareness"", wrote Hajeedar in his book, attracted much attention because now past dilapidated buildings had a better chance for renewal and sustainability with new uses. Subsequently, more restoration works were done within the historic core of KL such as the KL Memorial Library in the former Government Printing Press Building and the Islamic Affairs Department in what was previously the Chartered Bank Building.', ""These initial conservation efforts peaked when the historic colonial Carcosa and King's House were readapted as a boutique hotel called Carcosa Seri Negara in 1989 to coincide with the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (CHOGM), which saw England's Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip gracing the event."", '""It took a while before the National Heritage Act came into being in 2005,"" continues Hajeedar, adding that the Act incorporated all aspects — not only archaeological, above ground and below ground, in the seas, but also buildings of historic architectural significance. ""Then with that law, buildings were identified as our national heritage.""', 'A long sigh ensues as the 75-year-old looks intently at me. ""But I\'m still fighting the system,"" he confides, adding: ""Despite the Act\'s existence, these gazetted buildings have been left to dilapidate again. Have you seen the KL Railway Station and the hotel there lately? There\'s a national heritage plaque there and yet the buildings are overgrown with fungus and parasitic plants. I\'m saddened. There\'s no consistency and this is why I find it very challenging in our country.""', 'MEMORIES AND MILESTONES', '', '', ""Trawl through his tome as I did, and it's hard not to be impressed by Hajeedar's many achievements. His practice was the first local architectural office with full CADD capabilities in Malaysia."", ""In addition, he also designed and completed a total of 14 mosques and surau in Malaysia and one in the Republic of Maldives. Residents of Bangsar, KL might want to know that this is the man responsible for their impressive mosque, Masjid Saidina Abu Bakar As-Siddiq, the architect's first concrete mosque initiated in 1979."", '', '', 'Hajeedar was also the youngest artist to have his art works displayed and bought by the National Art Gallery (NAG). He was only 15. ""My work was in their permanent collection and in the company of renowned artists like Syed Ahmad Jamal, Cheong Lai Tong, and Hossein Enas and others,"" shares Hajeedar before confiding that he was also presented to Tunku Abdul Rahman when NAG was officiated.', 'Tell me more about your childhood, I probe, finally taking a sip of the now-lukewarm tea that his wife had kindly poured earlier. His grin is wide as he allows slivers of memory to rise.', '""Twelve of my formative years were spent at 155 Circular Road (Jalan Tun Razak), in a cluster of three identical government quarters set within two acres of land,"" remembers Hajeedar, continuing: ""The Director of Post and the Director of Malayan Film Unit were our \'neighbours\'. My father was sent to the UK for police training in 1952, leaving my mum to look after her two sons and seven daughters. She was assisted by our aunts.""', '', '', 'He recalls with much fondness how their compound was so large that they could have vegetable plots, chicken coops and banana and sugar cane clumps. There was a fast-flowing river at the rear called Sungai Bunus, which he fondly referred to as his Mississippi ""…because the gang would occasionally flow downstream on their banana-stem raft.', ""Other childhood distractions included grappling with a smelly pet goat and a pet centipede, which he'd bring to school in a matchbox. Unfortunately, he discovered only too late that although the centipede's stingers had been removed from the head, it hadn't, at the tail. And this he would discover in a painful lesson when he got badly stung and ended up with a swollen face."", ""His other interests, reveals Hajeedar with a youthful grin, was collecting the multi-coloured fighting fish, which he'd bring to school to fight with a friend's collection. The winner would go home with a fish of his choice from the loser's stash."", 'His introduction to art meanwhile, is also quite interesting. According to the affable architect, the government quarters where they resided was constructed of timber on elevated brick stoops, initially with thatched roof before being replaced by clay tiles.', '""I\'d draw on the regular timber panels of the building,"" he remembers, adding that after being told off by his mother, he started experimenting with other media such as powder and oil paints.', 'As a kid, Hajeedar happily shares that he was both mischievous and curious. ""I needed to know everything and the word \'why\' was most prominent in my vocab,"" he admits, adding: ""I\'d ask dad questions all the time and he\'d just retort I didn\'t need to know. Only much later I discovered that in police training, you don\'t have absolute trust even of your own colleagues.""', 'Chuckling, he recalls another episode: ""When I was young, I used to assert that my school never assigned homework. But that was until my mother (a homemaker) reminded me that she was once a school teacher and who was I trying to kid!""', 'In 1959 and after a special entry exam, the young Hajeedar was enrolled in one of the country\'s premier schools, Victoria Institution, where he was a student until 1963. ""The school\'s motto was \'Be Yet Wiser\'. I guess I\'m supposed to be wiser today!"" exclaims Hajeedar, grinning broadly.', 'His first ambition was to become a psychiatrist, I duly learn. He was motivated by the shocking experience of seeing a fully naked woman who\'d ""escaped"" from the nearby mental ward of KL General Hospital and into his house compound.', 'Thankfully, he was deterred from following through upon discovering that psychiatry was a post-graduate medical studies specialisation, and therefore, would take far too long to qualify!', 'Second on his list was accountancy because of his proficiency in Maths. But that option was binned after a ""brief sting"" as an article clerk trainee at Hanafiah Raslan Ong in Bangkok Bank Building, KL in 1966.', 'Hajeedar also had two scholarship offers to study at Universiti Malaya (UM) for Foreign Affairs and Civil Service. He rejected both! He wanted to pursue architecture, which unfortunately was not available there. Furious by his decision, his parents ordered him to ""fend for himself"". So he did, finding employment as an Assistant Traffic Officer (ATO) at Jabatan Telekom.', 'As fate would have it, MARA (Majlis Amanah Rakyat) advertised for a scholarship offer in Naval Architecture. And Hajeedar applied. ""But I cancelled the word \'naval\' and submitted my application form,"" he recalls, chuckling mischievously.', ""He was soon invited for an interview but found himself chastised by the panel of interviewers, which included Datuk Mansor Othman, Arshad Ayub and Amnah, for being disrespectful of the offer. However, against all odds, the young maverick found himself with a scholarship to pursue what he'd always wanted — architecture."", '', '', ""Day's turned to night and beyond the glass doors of Hajeedar's charming living room, I'm reminded of just how long I've stayed. One more question, Datuk, I signal. And he nods, completely unperturbed by the passing of time."", ""What's your proudest achievement?"", 'A pause ensues as Hajeedar reflects the question. Expression thoughtful, he replies: ""To have served my community. For example, with my mosques. I regard myself as a sinner — banyak dosa! So I\'m hoping for blessings. You know, build mosques so people can pray. That would be my proudest but also equally humbling achievement. I don\'t aspire to recognition or anything.

Vaccine hesitancy is a real issue in Malaysia, but it is a global phenomenon.', 'When our numbers were low anti-vaxxers were loud.

Some fear thatthe deterioration in mental health could linger long after the pandemic has subsided.', 'The data being collected from the studies, according to sociologist James Nazroo at the University of Manchester, the United Kingdom, is huge and may help in managing future pandemics.', 'For instance, more than 42 per cent of people surveyed by the United States Census Bureau in December reported symptoms of anxiety or depression, an increase from 11 per cent in the previous year.', 'Data from other surveys suggest the picture is similar worldwide. For Malaysia, this latest MCO could be psychologically stressful on the people, with some already showing signs of Movement Control Order fatigue.

Save Our Sea Turtles: was an online crowd-funding project led by our students in partnership with Rimbun Dahan Turtle Hatchery. This project supported the increase of the turtle population by raising money to buy turtle eggs that were to be incubated and released back into the ocean.', 'The main aim of Rimbun Dahan Turtle Hatchery was to save as many endangered Green Sea Turtle eggs hatched on the beaches along Chendor and Cherating in Pahang. Our students helped to raise RM2,506.00 within four days using the Kitafund.com, channelling the funds to Rimbun Dahan Turtle Hatchery.', '2. Virtual Run: was a race one could run at any location, at his or her own pace, outdoors or indoor on a treadmill. The purpose of this event was to create a heathier community during the MCO. There were about 70 participants including five senior citizens who joined the virtual run and gave positive feedback about the event.', '3. Tips for Tabs: was a project aimed at supporting under-privileged undergraduates in Kuantan, Pahang, by fundraising using Kitafund.com. The objective was to provide Samsung TAB-A to ten deserving students, who could use these tablets to improve their computer and social media skills.

This project received 250 online participants.', 'You can contribute to society by organising your own online community project.

Secondly, elect a capable leader together with a number of committee members.

Covid-19,LETTERS,2021-06-27 14:52:00,Ways to get the vaccine-hesitant Malaysians vaccinated,Dr Pola Singh,"['2', '', '', 'One of the proven effective measures in fighting the Covid-19 virus is revamping vaccinations until 70 to 80 per cent of the population has been vaccinated to reach herd immunity. Vaccination holds the key.', 'Indeed, this is now our major focus. Nationwide the total number of vaccine doses has crossed the seven-million mark. We are now averaging over 200,000 daily doses.', 'More and more mega vaccination centres (PPVs) are being opened especially in the Klang Valley. All of these efforts augur well for our energised vaccination drive. The light at the end of the tunnel is in sight! In short, we are on track.', 'But if the number of registrants do not keep pace with the capacity of the PPVs, sooner or later, these PPVs will be operating at less than full capacity. While KL, Putrajaya and Labuan have the highest percent of the adult population registered (up to 100 per cent), there are other states such as Sabah where only 30.88 per cent of the adult population have registered. This is a cause for concern.', 'There are also those who had registered but failed to turn up for their appointment and those who are vaccine hesitant. There are also a small group who have had their first dose but are reluctant to go for their second due to the adverse side effects they experienced earlier.', ""It's still an open question when we will actually be able to reach herd immunity if we do not address the concerns of the above segments of Malaysians including those who refuse to be vaccinated outright."", 'What then needs to be done to convert these vaccine-hesitant Malaysians to get vaccinated?', '1. Companies can do more to get their entire staff vaccinated. In addition to requiring new recruits to be vaccinated before they start work (similar to requiring new staff to take a medical examination), they can provide financial incentives. One media company has decided to give each of its 220 employees RM1,000 if they get vaccinated.', 'In addition, if ALL the employees are fully vaccinated, they will get an additional RM1,000. Indeed, peer pressure will come into play here to ensure that everyone in the company will enjoy an extra RM1,000.', '2. Organisations should empower vaccine acceptors, role models and informal leaders as advocates to serve as ""convert communicators"" by motivating and encouraging their more vaccine-hesitant co-workers to accept the vaccine. Sometimes it merely necessitates a nudge to get these recalcitrants to say yes.', '3. New social freedoms to encourage more Malaysians to get vaccinated. For instance, allowing those who have been vaccinated to enjoy certain privileges – e.g. freedom to travel interstate, travel overseas, attend sporting events, watch a movie in cinemas.', 'The private sector can also provide incentives such as providing free parking to patrons at shopping malls and entertainment centres as well as offer price discounts to those who have been vaccinated.', ""Finally, a plea to fellow Malaysians. We are all in this together. If you are not part of the solution (in getting vaccinated), then be mindful that you are indeed part of the problem. Let's all work together and do our patriotic duty to return our country to normalcy as soon as possible."", 'DR POLA SINGH', 'Kuala Lumpur', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '']"

But, it really didn't have to be this way. One main reason for our collective misery is not just the nature of the disease or a lack of preparedness and resources."", 'It is also because too many leaders around the world have failed at properly managing the pandemic, especially those who initially downplayed the severity of the virus when it first erupted.', 'Now, more people are getting angry. Last year in America, where more people died of Covid-19 related complications than anywhere else, Donald Trump was voted out of office, primarily because of his gross mismanagement of the crisis.', ""In Brazil, where more than half a million people have died of the virus and with the country poised to surpass the United States' death toll in the coming months, tens of thousands are taking to the streets in all 26 states to protest."", ""They are demanding the removal of President Jair Bolsonaro, with some saying the government's mishandling of the pandemic is a form of genocide."", ""Genocide may be overstating the case, but when one's president dismisses the illness as being no more than a mild case of the sniffles, the raw anger is perfectly understandable."", 'In India, whose official death count is nearly 400,000, a similar story has been playing out.

Thanks to vaccines, we can now reduce the worldwide mortality rate from this deadly virus. Traditionally, we need two doses of the same vaccine to induce the optimum amount of antibodies and protection against a disease.', 'The first dose is known as priming, an introduction of a foreign antigen to our immune system. The second dose (known as a booster) administered after an interval creates an immunologic memory against that particular antigen. The vaccine mix-and-match came into play and gained traction with the recently released data showing high efficacy and protection against various strains of the SARS COV-2 virus.', ""The Oxford Vaccine Group's Com-Cov (Comparing Covid-19 Vaccine Schedule Combinations) vaccine trial uses different combinations of approved Covid-19 vaccines for the first and second immunisation shots. The study is led by chief investigator Associate Professor Matthew Snape and is being delivered by a network of trial sites across the United Kingdom."", 'The Com-Cov study involved 850 volunteers aged 50 and above. The AstraZeneca and Pfizer vaccines were given four weeks apart and induced higher antibodies and T-cell responses than Pfizer followed by AstraZeneca.', 'Both of these mixes induced higher antibodies than two doses of AstraZeneca and gave better protection. The highest antibody response was seen after two doses of Pfizer, and the highest T-cell response was from AstraZeneca followed by Pfizer. Volunteers had a relatively tolerable reactogenicity profile (side effects).', 'Mixing the two types of vaccines may give the immune system multiple ways to recognise a pathogen. Different vaccines present the same information differently and may awaken other parts of the immune system or sharpen the immune response. This strategy could also make immunity last longer.', 'Another study by German researchers showed that administering the first dose with AstraZeneca followed by Pfizer elicits higher anti-spike titres and more neutralising activity against the Alpha, Gamma and Beta variants. Mixing Covid-19 vaccines is emerging as an excellent way to get people the protection they need when faced with safety concerns and unpredictable supplies.', 'Multiple studies now back up the idea that mixing the Oxford- AstraZeneca vaccine and the Pfizer–BioNTech vaccine triggers an immune response similar to — or even stronger than — two doses of either vaccine. Results announced last Monday by a UK group suggest that the combination sometimes outperforms two shots of the same vaccine.', 'The Ebola vaccine developed by Johnson & Johnson is an example of a mixed-dose approach. If the Covid-19 vaccine rollout applies the mix-and-match technique, it can significantly increase flexibility. Having a flexible immunisation programme allows us to vaccinate more people in the face of global supply constraints.', ""If there's a shortage of one vaccine, instead of halting the entire programme to wait for supply, the programme can continue with a different vaccine, regardless of which one has been given as a first dose."", ""Suppose one vaccine is less effective than another against a certain variant. In that case, mix-and-match schedules could ensure people who have already received one dose of a vaccine with lower effectiveness get a booster with a vaccine that's more effective against the variant."", 'Mixing the vaccines can help to prevent immunity against adenoviral-based vaccines. How? When it comes to Covid-19 vaccines, Russia\'s Sputnik V, Johnson & Johnson (J&J), CanSino Biologics and AstraZeneca products use a modified adenovirus to express the coronavirus spike protein that the immune system activates against. It is ""replication-deficient"", so it can\'t copy itself in the body once injected and give us a cold.', 'The immune system can develop a response against the adenovirus platform. Sputnik V uses a different adenovirus in each shot to get around this possible risk. If a third dose is needed, which is possible if vaccines are updated to address variants — a viral vector vaccine would not be optimal.', 'From this perspective, it makes sense to change platforms to mRNA or protein-based, like Novavax.', ""CanSino and J&J vaccines are easier to store and don't require people to return at a set time for the second jab — something that's hard to guarantee, especially in developing countries.

Yes, adolescence brings with it raging hormones that include physical changes and facial breakouts, but there are ways to mitigate the problem."", 'You may not be able to control your hormones, but there are many things in life that you can manage that might just alleviate the problem. If all that fails, perhaps a visit to a dermatologist might point you to the right direction or tell you about habits that you should ditch.', 'Dermalogica master instructor Sarah Morris says in her experience, children as young as 8 years old are already developing acne, possibly as a result of diet, stress and overexposure to digital screen.', 'She says while hormones play a role in acne, there are changes we can make in our life that might help us manage the condition. Some habits, she says, are just no-no and this includes over-cleansing using a bar soap, because soaps are often stronger than facial cleansers and instead of balancing the skin, they leave skin even drier and this worsens acne.', '""Soap is the enemy. It is going to strip your skin and destroy its moisture barrier. I cannot stress this enough — bar of soap, not your friend,"" says Morris during a Zoom presentation from her home in Florida.', 'She also emphasises facial cleanliness, and is especially against using porous items like sponges and loofahs.

The type of fabrics that you use could also play a role. Cotton is our best friend. It\'s the most breathable fabric, with the least amount of sweating and bacterial growth. If you are breaking out on your body, then maybe you need to look into the fabric of your clothes,"" she says.', '""Investing in masks is a good idea, and a combination of hydrating and clay mask could help you address the issue.

Small businesses are among the most vocal critics.', 'This is understandable, since they have been badly bruised as a result of the lockdowns and various movement control orders enforced to reduce infections.', 'Yet, infections have not shown any sign of abating. Some blame the emergence of new more infectious variants, especially the Delta variant.

Self-care is not self-indulgence. It is rather how we cope against modern urban life of unending stressors, the cause of much health travails that afflict far too many.', 'And as the Covid-19 pandemic has illustrated, the healthcare systems in most countries are vulnerable.', 'New York, for instance, has been swamped to such horrendous levels. And given how much self-care was instrumental in ensuring the control of the disease, if self-care had been the normative values of healthcare — washing our hands, keeping our distance from the infected, a common practice during flu outbreaks, wearing face masks, as is the practise in Japan to deal with the flu season — things might have been less dramatic.', 'Self-care would then be seen as what it is.

Why it far outstripped the severity of the seasonal flu has yet to be explained. Of course, high levels of hygiene among self-care practitioners would surely have made a difference.', 'It is then imperative that educating the public on self-care be pushed as a public health programme and there should be as much support as can be given to households to live the self-care way.

It has been around for over three decades.', 'Some equate gene editing to ""playing God"" as it involves meddling with genetic composition and making changes. Others are just grateful because it gives hope to themselves and their loved ones who are suffering from genetic disorders such as muscular dystrophy or cystic fibrosis.', ""To simply explain how gene editing works, we can say that it's a cut and paste system. You delete the unwanted gene and replace it with your gene of choice. Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR) is the latest form of gene editing, with two women awarded the 2020 Nobel Prize for its discovery."", 'Although there has been a lot of controversy and ethical concerns surrounding the CRISPR technology, it has extensively been studied to modify mosquito DNA to prevent malaria, modify crops to withstand harsh weather, cure genetic blindness ""retinitis pigmentosa"" and cancer immunotherapy testing for various types of cancer.', 'In addition, CRISPR revolutionised the medical world when it was used to treat and cure a patient with sickle cell disease.', 'The Covid-19 pandemic has shaken the global community. As the public shies away from Covid-19, the scientific world is embracing the challenge to discover new CRISPR-based Covid-19 detection and therapeutic methods.', 'Currently available methods for Covid-19 are RTK-Ag and RT-PCR, where RTK-Ag detects the presence of the virus in the body, while confirmation of infection is done using the RT-PCR technique.', ""However, RT-PCR has a 30 per cent chance of a false negative and takes about 24 hours from collection of the sample to the final result. Hence, there's a need for a detection method with high accuracy and rapid turnaround time."", 'The result of such endeavours is the DETECTR and SHERLOCK Covid-19 detection kits. SHERLOCK has become commercially available, while DETECTR has been given Food and Drug Administration approval to be used in one diagnostic centre in the United States. Both boast high specificity and shorter diagnosis times.', 'Other Covid detection methods undergoing research using the CRISPR technology are CARMEN, STOPCovid, SENA and several others. Malaysia may not have access to these CRISPR-based Covid-19 test kits, but a Malaysian company has successfully developed Covid test kits that have gained access to European markets.', 'CRISPR is seen as a potential antiviral therapy and researchers have evaluated the application\nof CRISPR to the Covid-19 viral genome. The CRISPR system has been discovered to target parts of the genome with more precision, sensitivity and specificity.', 'Conversely, further research is needed to fine-tune the system for future antiviral treatments. The 10-10 Malaysia Science, Technology, Innovation and Economy Framework was launched to ensure robust development of sectors that may act as drivers of economic growth.', 'One of the socioeconomic drivers listed under bioscience technology under this framework is the development of CRISPR\nfor antiviral treatment. Although CRISPR research here is still in its infancy, we are catching up in the biotechnology arena as Malaysia aims to be globally competitive in science and technology.', 'New technology always has both pros and cons. While the technology can be used for the betterment of agriculture and to find cures for diseases, there was a case where CRISPR was used to modify human embryo cells, leading to the birth of two gene-edited humans.', 'This caused an uproar in the\nscientific community and ethics bodies. Currently, Malaysia has no guidelines on gene editing, but Guidelines for Stem Cell Research and Therapy, National Standards for Stem Cell Transplantation and National Guidelines for Hemopoietic Stem Cell Therapy have existed since 2009.', 'It is notable that Malaysia began developing Guidelines for Registration of Cell and Gene Therapy Products in 2014, and it was to be enforced from 2021 to safeguard public health. Unfortunately, the Covid-19 pandemic has overshadowed any announcement of such guidelines.', 'However, in whatever scientific endeavours man undertakes, he needs to abide by regulatory and legislative policies and be accountable for all his actions.', ""Through elements of good governance, policymakers can ensure that such innovative technology is used for the public's benefit."", ""The National Institute of Public Administration concurs with policymakers that innovation is essential for a country's economic development and reiterates that governance of any gene-related therapies should abide by coordinated regulation and legislation."", '', 'katherine@intanbk.intan.my', 'The writer is senior training\nconsultant, Cluster for Public\nPolicy and Governance, National\nInstitute of Public Administration', '', '', '', 'Sabah MP suggests compulsory Covid-19 vaccination, single dose for those in rural areas', 'Covid-19 cases surpass 1 million, new daily high', 'Covid-19: New record high, 11,618 cases', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '']"

The idyllic scene belied the tragedy that had taken place several months earlier when the Malaysia Airlines (MAS) airplane, MH-17, was shot down here in July 2014 with the tragic loss of 298 lives.', 'As the plane began to touch down at the airport, I saw thick snow on the trees and roof tops. A large banner caught my eyes: ""Welcome to Dnipropetrovsk"". On one side of the runway was a long row of MIG-29 fighter jets ready for take-off, as pilots puffed away anxiously. On the other side was a long row of attack helicopter gunships, all fully loaded with machine guns ready.', 'Fully armed burly military guards were all around the airport. Their terse and tense manner painted a very different picture from the banner welcoming us. However, my initial sense of trepidation soon subsided when I saw the cheerful smiles of my friends, Professors Natalia Stukalo and Oleksii Dzhusov. Their friendly welcome warmed my heart in the freezing cold weather.', ""I'd been invited by Oles Honchar University to deliver some lectures. I was almost late for my lecture as my taxi driver grappled with daily name changes of roads and places."", '', '', ""As part of de-Sovietisation, for instance, the main Karl Marx Boulevard had been renamed Dmytra Avenue. All statues of Marx, Stalin and Lenin were hurriedly torn down by local mobs throughout Ukraine. Even the city's name had been subsequently changed to Dnipro."", 'Ukraine was then going through the throes of a revolution and an intense war. There were long columns of tanks and armoured cars.

Some exclaimed that I was crazy to even think of going. ""Don\'t you know there\'s a war going on there?"" some had incredulously pointed out.', '', '', 'Despite the potential risks involved in my trip, I nevertheless took up the challenge and invitation by the honourable Minister Dmitri Senyk and Ambassador Nataliya Zhynkina.

I'd been invited by my friend, Professor Marcin, to lecture at Jagiellonian University, one of the oldest universities in the world."", ""Among its alumni is Copernicus, famous for his helio-centrism for which Galileo was forced to recant by the Pope. This reminds us of the heavy price for seeking and speaking the truth, exemplified by Socrates' drinking of hemlock."", 'After our lecture, my students brought me to visit their beautiful medieval city square. In 1238 AD, the Polish sentry at the watchtower rang the church bell to warn its residents of the approaching Mongolian army. However, sadly, the city was brutally sacked in the end.', 'As the Auschwitz concentration camp was nearby, I took the opportunity to learn about its tragic history. At its entrance was a quote by George Santanaya: ""Those who do not remember the past are condemned to repeat it"".', 'It was indeed heart rending to see the gas chambers and the skulls. Many of them were victims of the deadly experiments by the ""Angel of Death"", Dr Mengele.', ""It's truly a gruesome reminder of the atrocities committed by the Germans during the war. It underscores the importance of international friendship and understanding to avoid wars."", 'FINLAND — THE HAPPIEST COUNTRY ON EARTH', 'After my lectures and conference in Warsaw, I flew north to Helsinki. The Scandinavians have a different culture and character from other Europeans. What impressed me was their Social Democratic principles which show a genuine care for its people.

These ""Palaces for the People"" reflect their egalitarian belief that the beauty of art should be enjoyed by the masses and not confined to the royals.', 'My students regaled me with the story of the bloody Bolshevik Revolution in October 1917, which saw the rise of Lenin and the civil war between the Red and White armies.', 'This resulted in the overthrow of Tsar Nicholas and the ruthless assassination of his family. Intrigued by this tragedy, I also visited St Petersburg and the Winter Palace to learn more about this sad episode in history.', 'GERMANY, THE ECONOMIC AND INTELLECTUAL POWERHOUSE', 'After St Petersburg, I flew south to Berlin, the capital of Germany. I took the opportunity to visit its famous Reichstag, Brandenburg Gate and the ""Berlin Wall"".', 'After my tour, I proceeded to Gottingen University which boasts of the biggest number of Nobel Prize scientists before the war. Among them were Gauss, Max Planck and Oppenheimer, the ""Father of the Atomic Bomb"". It\'s also renowned for sociologist Weber and Habermas.', 'Gauss was a mathematical genius. At the age of three, he could compute complex calculations. Until today, all their graduating PhD students in Mathematics would have to kiss his tomb stone.', 'After that, they would have to bring flowers and kiss the Ganseliesel, a poor princess in an old fairy tale, in the city square. My students confessed that they would rather kiss the princess than Gauss.', 'During dinner, I was heartened to hear from my professorial colleagues that Germany has fully atoned for its atrocities during the war.

However, Japan has neither officially apologised nor made any compensation.', 'To seek closure and build trust, German Chancellor Angela Merkel had urged Japan to learn from the example of Germany in properly atoning for its crimes and atrocities.

Overlooking the Danube River is the Buda Castle. It's a beautiful United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (Unesco) heritage site and many movies have been filmed there."", 'After our lectures, Professor Buda treated me to a wonderful dinner on a cruise along the Danube. It was a cool, breezy evening. During dinner, he regaled me with his stories as a member of the UN Peacekeeping force during the Vietnam War in 1972.', 'The following year, Professor Buda visited me while I was teaching in Vietnam. It was a nostalgic trip for him as it had been 50 years since the end of the Vietnam War.', 'Although both his hairline and the skyline have changed much, surprisingly, he managed to find his old bar and its owners again. As he retraced his journey in Vietnam, it brought back special memories and some tears to him.', 'VIETNAM — PHOENIX RISING FROM THE ASHES OF WAR', '', '', 'After defeating the French at Dien Bien Phu in 1954, Vietnam continued its war against the Americans until the fall of Saigon in 1975. It had suffered terribly, thanks to the devastating effects of Agent Orange and Napalm bombs used by the Americans.', 'The Vietnamese people are generally resourceful and resilient. After some initial struggles, the country is now a roaring tiger economy. In Hanoi, my students would pray to Confucius at the Temple of Literature before their final examination.', 'Without fail, Professor Tran, Vo and Van would bring me to experience their delicious cuisine and drinks. The Vietnamese would boast about their homemade wine, prepared by soaking a king cobra and some white mice in a big jar of special alcoholic herbal concoction.', 'It is believed to make one strong and young again. Professor Thanh challenged me to drink some of his grandfather\'s ""special wine"". After one gulp, I had to surrender. Let\'s just say its taste was unforgettable.', 'Besides its addictive coffee culture, Vietnam boasts of a strong karaoke culture. One could hear loud singing everywhere throughout the day and night. They sing happily at weddings and even at funerals too.', ""With a constant flow of music, coffee and alcohol, it's little wonder that Vietnam ranks among the happiest countries in the world. The friendly folks in the Mekong delta, especially, are the happiest."", 'CHINA — AWAKENING OF AN ANCIENT CIVILISATION', '', '', ""Before visiting China, my mind had been filled with images of corruption, pollution and degradation propagated by the world's media. Eager to learn the truth, I accepted the invitation to be Visiting Professor to the renowned Sichuan University in Chengdu."", 'After our lectures, my post-graduate students invited me for lunch and showed me around their city. It was late autumn and the air was cool and clear. The golden gingko trees added a beautiful shine to the city. There was little pollution and traffic was smooth-flowing.', 'My students brought me to visit the historic Liu Bei tomb and Zhang Fei Temple.

Being English educated, I regretted not knowing enough Chinese to fully appreciate its rich culture and long history.', '', '', 'They also brought me to visit their world-famous panda sanctuary and Dujiangyan, an impressive Unesco heritage site dating back to 256 BC.', 'Besides enjoying the tour, I learnt something new from some of my students. Being ethnic minorities, they enjoyed extra points in the competitive college entrance examination and some discounts in their school fees too.', 'The ethnic minorities were also exempted from China\'s harsh ""One Child policy"", resulting in their strong population increase. Notably, both the lifespan and population of the Uighurs in Xinjiang have more than doubled in recent decades. This debunked the genocide theory propagated by some western media.', 'Besides Chengdu, I also visited Beijing. Some of the students showed me the ruins of their Imperial Summer Palace. It was brutally ransacked by the British and French armies during the Opium War in 1860. Sadly, most of its inhabitants were killed and all the priceless antiques were looted by the invading armies.', 'Today, many of these antiques can be found in the museums and mansions in London, Paris and New York. Although my students were saddened by this tragedy, what I found admirable was the fact that they harboured no sense of revenge or vindictiveness.', 'After a century of humiliation, China is finally re-emerging as an economic powerhouse. Some Western media have claimed that China is trying to colonise the world today. In my interactions with its people, there was never any hint of such hegemonic ambition.', 'If China had intentions to conquer the world, it would have done so during the Ming Dynasty when Admiral Zheng sailed around most of the world with his mighty fleet. Instead, the Chinese Emperor married off his beloved princess Hang Li Po to Sultan Mansur Shah of Melaka in the 15th century.', 'The wise and old ex-prime minister of Malaysia Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad had once reminded us: ""We always say, we have had China as a neighbour for 2,000 years, we were never conquered by them. But the Europeans came in 1509, in two years, they conquered Malaysia.""', 'China has successfully uplifted 800 million of its people from poverty through sheer diligence and self-sacrifice. It has also been playing a responsible international role.', ""Despite the US withdrawal earlier, China has been strongly supporting the World Climate Treaty and the UN Peacekeeping force. Instead of vaccine-hoarding like some western countries, China has been sending huge quantities of vaccines and medical supplies to other countries to help combat the Covid-19 pandemic. However, the western media criticised China's earnest efforts as vaccine diplomacy."", 'To promote international friendship, we need to make an honest effort to seek the truth, build trust and understanding. This is especially crucial given the tension brewing between the two super-powers in the world today.', 'As Professor Jeffrey Sachs (UN Special Ambassador) lamented, the US trade war, tech war and sanctions against China hurt not only China but the international economy too.', 'Having lived and worked in the West, I have enjoyed its personal liberty, social diversity and democratic plurality. However, there are also aspects of Eastern culture which are equally important, such as public safety, social stability and personal responsibility.', 'Compared with Western nations, many East Asian countries have controlled the Covid-19 pandemic better, thanks to better social discipline and public order. The rampant chaos and tragic anti-Asian hate crimes in the West show that excessive personal liberty can bring more harm than good.', 'FOR THE SAKE OF HUMANITY', 'We need to accept and respect the fact that different countries have different cultures and ways of life. No country should impose its system and ideology on others. This rich historical complexity and cultural diversity are what make our world an interesting one.', 'In the face of serious problems such as Covid-19 and climate change, all countries should unite and cooperate to tackle these common challenges together.', 'With time running out, it is imperative that our world leaders show the necessary courage and wisdom to work together to overcome these existential challenges for the sake of humanity.', ""Gary Lit Ying Loong is a retired academic from Nanyang Technological University (NTU), Singapore.

Had it not been extended until February next year, the current Sarawak assembly (whose term officially ran out in early June) will have to be dissolved and, as constitutionally mandated, a new state election will have to be called within 60 days.', 'What practically everyone dreads is that if a state election were to be held in the next few months, while the Covid-19 daily case count in the state shows no signs of going on a downtrend, a public health disaster of the scale Sabah experienced after its election may occur.', 'However, there is a peculiarity pertinent only to Sarawak currently. If Parliament sat even during an Emergency, should the Sarawak assembly not convene between now and next February, particularly in November when the annual state budget is traditionally presented?', 'As assemblyman See Chee How pointed out, there is an anomaly in that the proclamation of Emergency does not state whether its June expiry is also suspended. Unless clarified, the validity of any assembly sitting before February may be questionable.', ""The bright spot amid the political uncertainty is that Sarawak's vaccination rollout is on course to herd immunity by the end of this month."", 'When that happens, perhaps the Emergency will be shortened and a state election can be called before year end. This will void the question of whether the state will enter 2022 without a new legislatively approved budget.', 'The pandemic and its far-reaching effects are seeping into every facet of our lives and being. Nothing seems to be right and normal any longer. The usual rule book on almost anything needs to be re-written or even re-invented.', 'It has become a cliché but still bears repeating that under such unusual circumstances, we need all hands on deck to tackle the multi-headed monster the Covid-19 virus has morphed into. Nobody can claim to have superior smarts in addressing something none of us has experienced in our lifetime, least of all, opposing camps of politicians.', 'Even advanced countries such as Australia have endured weeks of lockdowns without much noticeable breaks in the virus, particularly the highly infectious new variants, taking hold. We at least have the enviable record of our national immunisation drive moving apace fairly briskly towards its desired end-goal.', 'True, there is much suffering and distress among Malaysians in the wake of the havoc the pandemic has wreaked. The economy is disrupted as global supply chains, of which Malaysia is a significant cog, buckle. And our national government, if not exactly overwhelmed as many less fortunate countries are saddled with, is — in the words of Prime Minister Tan Sri Muhyiddin Yassin— not perfect.', 'Equally true, no national crisis should be wasted. There are reforms that economic and other experts have long advocated we should be ushering in.', 'Sometimes, these can be so difficult to initiate politically that a crisis as momentous as the pandemic may be what we need to goad us down that path.', 'Our national politics is in a flux, no thanks to what hit us just prior to the pandemic, in 2018. That will naturally take its time to arrive at a new, hopefully stable, equilibrium.', 'In the meantime, let us all take to heart the little bright spot that Sarawak seems to be offering: political camps reaching some level of consensus on the most important tasks at hand and taking things forward from there.', 'Also, staying focused on a key pre-requisite that will liberate us from any pandemic-induced logjam— vaccinating as many people as we can, as soon as possible.', '', 'The writer views developments in the nation, region and wider world from his vantage point in Kuching, Sarawak', '', '', '', 'PM confident he has support of majority', 'Cabinet, govt machinery continues to function, says Muhyiddin', '2022 Budget to focus on recovery, resilience and reform, says PM', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '']"

Uncertain economic conditions since the start of the pandemic has affected many, including the agriculture and food industries.', 'The food supply chain can be described as the different processes that occur to bring food from production to the consumer, or from farm to fork.', 'Generally, the supply chain consists of processes such as agricultural production, post-harvest handling, processing, distribution and retail, and lastly consumption.', 'The maintenance of a functional food supply chain is important in ensuring food can be provided to consumers continuously. One of the impacts of Covid-19 is the restriction of movements, causing issues in the supply chain.', 'As an example, the Movement Control Order (MCO) implemented travel restrictions that were further enforced by roadblocks, as well as the limitation of a 10-km travel radius.', 'When workers are unable to go to work due to travel restrictions, the processes in the supply chain will be incapacitated. Recent loosening of restrictions allows workers to continue working with permission from the International Trade and Industry Ministry.', 'Similarly, when some companies are not allowed to operate, it eventually limits the circulation of a balanced supply chain.', 'For example, the mushroom industry is impacted by a lack of sawdust material from the wood industry. Sawdust is the main material required as a substrate for mushroom cultivation.', 'Previously, lockdowns have led to other disruptions in the food supply chain due to a shortage of labour, one of the main difficulties faced by local farmers in food production. They faced many obstacles as they are reliant on workers to harvest crops, as well as for the preparation of land.', 'Thus, when workers face difficulty in travelling, food production will be disrupted. Moreover, labour shortages will also affect the food distribution system.', 'Labour shortages also cause farmers to lose revenue. For example, due to the first MCO, 2,300 farmers reportedly lost RM1 million per day as they could not sell their harvested produce and they were discarded as waste.', 'Similarly, it was reported that about 200 farmers were unable to sell their vegetables in Gua Musang, leading to a total loss of RM400,000 a day.', 'They were forced to discard up to 200 metric tonnes of vegetables per day. This situation occurs as consumers opt for online purchases rather than going out to obtain their weekly groceries.', 'Hence, many farmers are facing this problem. Some of the farmers even send their produce out to charity, or those who raise up white flags at their homes due to financial difficulties.', 'Due to the strict lockdowns, as well as many protocols involving physical distancing and travel restrictions, the food supply chain has been affected.

The famous ""Serenity Prayer"" quoted as ""God, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, courage to change the things I can, and wisdom to know the difference"" helps us understand human limitations and the mantra of a happy life.', 'Here are some strategies to cope with the prolonged uncertainties to stay in the game.', 'First, we should maintain our daily living routines. Disrupted routines may make ""work-life balance"" sound mythical.', 'Maintaining conscious creative routines, such as getting up at the same time every day, getting showered and dressed up in the morning, as well as exercise, can keep us active and engaged, providing a sense of normality.', 'Second, we should plan our time well. Time allotment for the various tasks does not need to be strict but instead flexible.', 'However, it is important to prioritise the tasks. The apt action at this hour is to invest in ""yourself"". It can be joining online courses, learning new skills, trying new things and investing in relationships.', 'Third, as social beings, we need to connect with others. We can use online platforms to stay connected with our dear ones. Distancing ourselves from negative social media messages that are not based on facts is essential to maintaining a positive mood. Keeping a healthy balance on the use of social media is crucial.', 'Fourth, healthy eating, sleep hygiene and exercise are essential. A balanced healthy diet has a direct impact on mood. Good sleep hygiene and routine help us sync with our biological clock.', 'For instance, one should go to sleep, wake up and get out of bed at the same time each day, stay active in the day, restrict caffeine intake, avoid electronics and bright lights in the bedroom.', 'Regular exercise has a vital and positive role in our physical and mental health. Online exercise classes and clubs are good options to stay active.', 'When structuring your daily routine, make time for fun home activities and virtual meet-ups. You can do this by playing games, do things to make you laugh and have fun, as well as singing and dancing.', 'Self-care includes any activity that is caring, nurturing and healthy for oneself, such as yoga, exercise and sleep.', 'Fifth, whether we like it or not, we are constantly observed by people around us, especially our children at home. They see and learn from us. We can be their role model by first accepting our emotions and being open about our feelings. We can also label them.', 'For example, ""I am worried about my job, but I have decided to think differently. Maybe it will open a new opportunity. I am frustrated about the situation, but it\'s okay to feel like that. I\nwill continue to do the best I can.""', 'We can structure the day by staying connected with family and friends, limiting our time with gadgets, exercising regularly, enjoying a good sleep, adopting healthy eating habits, making time for fun and leisure activities, maintaining calmness and adopting a problem-solving mindset.', 'Sixth, we should practise gratitude. We need to focus on things we are grateful for. Such reflections of gratitude can fill us with positivity. Maintaining a daily gratitude diary can help us notice at least one to two things we are grateful for each day.', 'These strategies will help us cope with the prolonged uncertainties brought by the pandemic.', '', 'The writer is a senior lecturer at the Faculty of Medicine, AIMST University', '', '', '', 'Fly Jalur Gemilang to show solidarity, unity in Covid fight', 'Majority of Covid-19 clusters in Selangor are from factories', 'MAIK hopes additional allowance for imam, muezzin will help ease their burdens', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '']"

Currently in the United States, cases are increasing among students as they start the school year.', 'We recognise that reopening schools brings increased risk to the health of schoolchildren, school staff and their families, due to prolonged contact with high numbers of people from multiple households.', 'Risks notwithstanding, not opening schools at all could cause developmental and educational losses in children that could have exponential effects in later years.', 'Whenever schools do reopen, risk mitigation strategies and contingency plans are needed to avoid outbreaks of school clusters, given that the pandemic situation does not seem to be improving quickly enough.', 'Early planning can help address the risks and challenges of reopening schools.

A cohort is a group of students and staff who learn, work and dine together. Cohort members have little or no contact with others outside their group.', 'Cohorts decrease transmission risk by limiting the number of contacts any one person has in a school day.

Thus, schools should develop contact tracing guidelines before reopening and review and update the guidelines regularly.', 'Contingency plans should also involve clear communications protocol, strategies for how to continue classes for affected cohorts and metrics for quarantine and return to school.', 'For example, clear benchmarks on when to quarantine a cohort versus closing the whole school should be set before schools reopen.', 'Schools need to work with local public health authorities to develop a system for tracking and sharing data about cases and outbreaks while maintaining privacy.', 'Parents and teachers need to be forthcoming about reporting positive cases to school and public health authorities. Withholding information could put other students and the whole community at increased risk of infection.', 'The decision to reopen schools goes hand-in-hand with risk assessment and strategies to overcome these risks. Although there are risks that reopening schools will worsen the state of the pandemic in our country, there are good reasons to reopen schools.', 'Remote learning has proven to be a challenge due to inequalities in access to a conducive learning environment, devices, and high-quality internet connections.', 'The digital divide and a difficult learning environment have set underprivileged students back in their education.

Other diseases, too, have started to spin off the scourge.', 'Black fungus or mucormycosis is one of them. The term is not new, as it was first identified by Arnold Paltauf in 1885.', 'However, it is only now that people are becoming increasingly aware of it due to its association with Covid-19.', 'Mucormycosis has been dubbed ""black fungus"" because it causes blackening or discolouration of the nose.', 'It is a rare but opportunistic fungal infection with a high morbidity and mortality rate.', 'The spores can be found in fruits, soil, faeces and are present in the air.', 'Spores can be inhaled through the nose, mouth or even enter the body through a cut in the skin. Once they grow in the nose, they destroy bones in the nose and sinuses and can even lead to blindness.', 'Once the fungus enters the cranial cavity, it can block major arteries and veins, resulting in major life-threatening brain strokes.', ""Our body's defence mechanisms keep the fungi at bay. However, a weakened immune system will allow these organisms to unleash morbid and lethal infections. People who are at risk include diabetics, as well as those suffering from leukaemia, renal failure, protein-calorie malnutrition and cirrhosis."", 'The disease also attacks patients who have undergone transplants and those on corticosteroid and immunosuppressive therapy.', 'Local factors that can spark the disease include burns, knife wounds, insect bites, needle pricks and trauma.', 'Mucormycosis may be also triggered by the use of steroids, a life-saving treatment for severe and critically ill Covid-19 patients.', ""Steroids reduce inflammation in the lungs for Covid-19 and appear to help stop some of the damage that can happen when the body's immune system goes into overdrive to fight off coronavirus."", 'But they also reduce immunity and push up blood sugar levels in both diabetic and non-diabetic Covid-19 patients, thereby helping the spread of black fungus.', ""Diabetes lowers the body's immune defences, coronavirus exacerbates it, and then steroids which help fight Covid-19 act like fuel to the fire."", 'When it comes to Covid-19, there are two types of mucormycosis observed in patients: rhino-orbito-cerebral mucormycosis and pulmonary mucormycosis.', 'In rhino-orbito-cerebral mucormycosis, the infection begins from the nose and spreads along the sinus passage to infect the eyes and brain.', 'Nose blockage, unusual nasal discharge, facial swelling, pain and numbness are some of the initial symptoms. Over time, this may result in headache, eye pain, blurred vision and partial blindness.', 'Pulmonary mucormycosis primarily affects the lungs and the respiratory system. Those who catch it develop symptoms such as fever, cough, shortness of breath and chest pains.', 'As the infection spreads and it is not treated in time, it may lead to the development of pleural effusion, also known as ""water in the lungs"".', 'To prevent a black fungus infection we offer the following suggestions.', 'First, the public should maintain strict oral hygiene. This is especially important for those recuperating from a Covid-19 infection.', 'This is because the intake of steroids and other medication enables bacteria in the mouth to grow, hence brushing twice or thrice a day and the use of mouthwash can help stave off the infection.', 'Patients are also advised to change their toothbrush once they test negative and keep rinsing their mouth regularly.', 'Second, diabetic patients must undergo frequent periodic testing of their sugar level.', 'Third, the public should avoid exposure to dust and moisture and keep their distance from soil, trees and plants. If they display symptoms, they should immediately report themselves to the medical authorities.', 'Fourth, to keep sinuses clear the people should try steam inhalation.', 'Fifth, the people are strongly advised to not self-medicate, especially if it involves the use of steroids.', 'If everyone plays a part in preventing it, black fungus would not take hold in Malaysia as it has in India and other parts of the world.', '', 'The writer is an associate professor in Oral Medicine and Maxillofacial Radiology, Faculty of Dentistry, AIMST University', '', '', '', 'Malaysia hits record 22,242 new Covid-19 cases', 'Slight dip in Covid-19 cases today at 19,740', 'Fourth day Covid-19 cases breach 20,000 mark', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '']"

At that time, the prevalent strain was also the Delta variant, making the cases more transmissible.', '""However, the response of getting everyone vaccinated as quickly as possible turned things around. They were administered Pfizer and Sinovac vaccines, which served as proof that regardless of the type of vaccine given, they were all the protective,"" she said.', 'Now, cases in Labuan are in the single digits, with an R0 of zero.', '""The hope is that we (Penang) will get there soon too. While vaccinations would reduce high-risk cases, to tackle sporadic cases, we can try to protect ourselves as much as we can.', '""Self-test after returning from a high-risk area if we think that we have been exposed or before we meet anyone who is unvaccinated.

The whole effort for a working solution took time.', 'Whereas, for most of the retailers, the waiting game had just started and time was really money in retrospect. In other words, the longer that the retailers waited, the larger the financial impact would be on them.', 'Concurrently, the whole ideology of vaccination also began to kick-start where top biologists and epidemiologists outlined the significance of their roles in preventing the further spread of Covid-19 and the race against time to produce the vaccines.', 'One key question begs to be answered. Is the vaccine the ultimate bulletproof to bring us all back to normalcy or the pre-pandemic days?', 'Shweta Bansal, a mathematical biologist at Georgetown University in Washington DC said, ""Herd immunity is only relevant if we have a transmission-blocking vaccine. If we don\'t, then the only way to get herd immunity in the population is to give everyone the vaccine"".', 'Bansal also emphasised that those who have been infected with Covid-19 seemed to have developed some sort of immunity to the virus (after recovery), but how long that will last remains unanswered. It also seems that infection-associated immunity wanes over time, so that needs to be factored into calculations too.', 'Now, if we were to carefully read between the lines, the truth is, no one is yet safe from this deadly virus.', 'Based on this judgement, a blanket ban by certain mall operators on all unvaccinated persons from entering the shopping malls beginning September 15, 2021 has to be re-examined taking into consideration that vaccinated individuals with double-doses can still be the main source of transmission.', 'This action is deemed shortsighted and slapdash to a certain extent as it outrightly discriminates the rights of unvaccinated shoppers who mostly are still waiting for their turns to get the vaccines administered as well as the rights of the retailers to gain more customers.', 'This particular ban ruling does not justify or corroborate the whole concept of vaccination. In short, the common denominator that both vaccinated and unvaccinated persons have is the fact that they can still transmit and be infected with Covid-19.', 'On September 4, 2021, a total of 19,057 Covid-19 cases were reported in Malaysia. Interestingly, 4,939 cases or 23.1 per cent of reported cases were individuals who had received at least one vaccination shot or have not passed 14 days from their second shot.', 'Meanwhile, a total of 6,120 cases or 32.1 per cent of Covid-19 positive cases have completed vaccination history. These statistics from the Ministry of Health are again telling us that vaccinated persons are still not out of the danger yet.', 'On hindsight, shopping malls could probably not have undergone closure for such a long period of time during the lockdowns, if only the SOP especially those closely related to the accommodation of foreign workers across all industries, were strictly enforced and implemented to safeguard the interests of retailers and their loyal customers.', 'In business, best practices involve the implementation of well-thought initiatives that are proven to be effective in achieving greater end results. In this case, adhering to the SOP is the way forward.', 'The mall management should work hand-in-hand with the relevant agencies more aggressively in order to allocate more auxiliary police and RELA officers to perform close surveillance on the SOP.', 'Better still, qualified SOP marshals ought to be hired on a permanent basis and stationed in the mall(s) to carry out these responsibilities and', 'eventually to reduce the reliance on random checks by the authorities.', 'Like it or not, the mall management has to lead by example in providing out-of-the-box solutions to cater for both vaccinated and unvaccinated shoppers. On top of this, the onus of prevention should also be shifted to retailers overseen by the mall management.', 'It goes without saying that the mall operators must consistently play their part to actively educate the public about the importance of adhering to the SOP instead of sending the wrong message about the real purpose of vaccination that it can cure Covid-19 permanently.', ""'Medio tutissimus ibis' i.e. 'You will go most safely by the middle course'.

Covid-19,COLUMNISTS,2021-09-12 17:48:00,"Should we worry about heavy school bags, scoliosis?",Dr Lim Sze Wei,"['1', '', '', 'WITH schools reopening soon, it is time again for children to lug their heavy bags after almost two years of virtual learning. Prior to the pandemic, the topic of heavy school bags has been widely debated and the health issue that is commonly associated with it is scoliosis, a curvature of the spine that is often diagnosed in adolescents.', 'In Malaysia, studies suggest that scoliosis affects two to three per cent of the population — between 600,000 and 900,000 people. Scoliosis usually affects teenagers from the ages of 10 to 17 during their growth spurt.', 'The curves are often C-shaped or S-shaped and anything that measures more than 10 degrees on an X-ray is considered scoliosis. Possible complications of scoliosis include chronic pain, breathing difficulties, and a reduced capacity for exercise.', ""For many years, people have mistakenly believed that heavy bags can cause the spine to curve. However, research and medical reports have noted that there are no associations between the occurrence of scoliosis and heavy school bags. It also doesn't support the idea that heavy bag can structurally change a child's growing spine."", 'Although heavy bags do not cause scoliosis, using them incorrectly or for prolonged periods can cause other forms of spinal problems such as back pain, bad posture, muscle weakness and fatigue. It is proven that adolescents who suffer from back pain will probably have chronic back pain as adults.', 'So, what really causes scoliosis? For one, scoliosis is not caused by carrying heavy school bags or anything a child or parent did or did not do. Scoliosis can occur in people with conditions such as cerebral palsy or muscular dystrophy but in most cases, scoliosis is idiopathic - which means there is no known cause. Nonetheless, there are a few risk factors that have been identified such as:', 'Age – Most cases occur when a child reaches their growth spurt at the age of 10 and older; Gender – Girls might have a higher risk of developing scoliosis than boys; and', 'Family History – Scoliosis can be inherited genetically from parents, affected siblings or close relatives with the condition', 'Most cases of scoliosis are mild, but some curves worsen as children grow and severe scoliosis can be disabling. Cases of scoliosis with a known cause are rarer than idiopathic scoliosis cases. Non-idiopathic scoliosis is often caused by a poorly developed spine or as a side effect of other diseases such as neuromuscular conditions, connective tissue disorders, and genetic conditions.', 'Scoliosis can worsen very quickly during adolescence because the child is growing fast during this period. The symptoms are also not always obvious in mild cases, thus, it is important that parents check their children from time to time. The earlier it is detected, the better the odds of preventing scoliosis from causing serious issues down the line.', 'The good news is parents can easily check for signs and symptoms of scoliosis at home. One of the most prevalent signs of scoliosis that can be observed include a difference in the height or position of shoulders, shoulder blades or hips – for example, one shoulder seems to be consistently drooping below the other. Another one is the head not being centred with the rest of the body.', ""Parents may also do a quick 'Adam's Forward Bend Test' to see the curvature of the spine. They can do this by asking their children to bend forward with both palms between the knees, any disparity in the rib cage or other deformities along the back could be a sign of scoliosis. If there is a suspicious situation, it is absolutely necessary to consult the doctor without wasting time."", 'For mild scoliosis cases, nonsurgical treatment methods such as exercise and bracing can help to slow or stop the progression of the curve, and it can also help to relieve the back pain associated with the condition.', 'However, these methods cannot fix the curvature in the spine and patients will need to be monitored throughout their lives to ensure that the condition does not worsen.', ""Surgery is only necessary if the curvature in the spine is severe and interferes with the patient's quality of life. If surgery is necessary, advances in surgical methods have made for a safe and effective procedure, with much shorter recovery times than were associated with scoliosis surgery in the past."", ""At ALTY Orthopaedic Hospital, when determining a child's best treatment plan for scoliosis, our team of specialists considers the severity of the curve, where it occurs in the spine, and the child's age and stage of growth."", 'If there is a delay of many months in diagnosis or follow-up, we may miss the chance to use very effective methods to prevent scoliosis progression during growth and it can make the treatment more challenging.', ""It is critical that new scoliosis cases continue to be treated as quickly as possible, notwithstanding Covid-19. In adolescent cases particularly, even a few weeks can make a significant difference to the path of treatment as well as the potential outcome. The pandemic may have put a stop to many activities in our lives, but it hasn't stopped kids from growing fast."", ""As a healthcare provider, I would recommend parents to consult their medical practioners as soon as they detect any changes in the child's growth. With routine check-ups and timely intervention, conditions like scoliosis can be managed better, giving you child a better quality of life."", 'The writer is consultant orthopaedic, Spine and Trauma Surgeon, ALTY Orthopaedic Hospital', '', 'Education Ministry will not force parents to send their children to school', 'Ismail Sabri confident of hitting NIP target sooner', 'Speaking Mandarin a cinch for Malay siblings', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '']"

Perhaps that perspective may be true, but there are several root causes to this problem.
